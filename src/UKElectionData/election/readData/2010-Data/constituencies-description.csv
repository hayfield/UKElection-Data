"1","11","Amber Valley","Amber_Valley","To the north of Derby city and to the west of the M1 motorway, this mixed seat is criss-crossed by A-roads, with towns of Alfreton, Ripley and Heanor \u2013 where the BNP do well \u2013 and several villages packed around them. The River Amber cuts through the northern corner. Manufacturing dominates the economy and the seat has a high proportion of working-class residents. There are pockets of deprivation, but much of the area is averagely well-off. It was Conservative from 1983 until 1997. Under boundary changes it has lost areas from the south and northwest of the seat.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Judy Mallaber"
"2","19","Ashfield","Ashfield","Ashfield is on the border with Derbyshire. The M1 cuts through this populated seat, with the towns of Sutton-in-Ashfield, Kirkby-in-Ashfield and Eastwood and villages such as Annesley. The decline of coalmining and textile industries hit the area hard. Ashfield\u2019s last pit closed just after the millennium. D.H. Lawrence was born in Eastwood but the area&apos;s claim to literary fame is surpassed by its cricketing heritage. Five future England Test players \u2013 including Harold Larwood and Bill Voce \u2013 worked at Annesley Colliery. The seat has a long Labour tradition, interrupted only by a Conservative by-election victory in 1977.","The current MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Geoff Hoon, who was suspended from the Labour party in March"
"3","35","Bassetlaw","Bassetlaw","This Nottinghamshire constituency borders South Yorkshire and is predominantly rural. It has been substantially redrawn and increased by about 7,000 electors, gaining the town of Retford, but losing Warsop, which has large areas of severe deprivation. The coalfields seat was devastated by the decline of the mining industry. Premier Foods is a major employer, making Oxo in Worksop. The seat has a long history of loyalty to Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Mann"
"4","75","Bolsover","Bolsover","Bolsover Castle overlooks the M1 motorway in this seat, which lies to the east of Chesterfield and southeast of Sheffield. At the heart of the coalfields, this has always been working class but the closure of the pits left severe deprivation in many of the urban areas. Beyond the main towns of Bolsover and Shirebrook are several large villages. Regeneration projects are slowly improving the area but this is a seat that shares many of the challenges faced by post-industrial Yorkshire. It was made famous by the local \u201cBeast\u201d Dennis Skinner and has been solidly Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Dennis Skinner"
"5","80","Boston & Skegness","Boston_and_Skegness","This seat spans from Skegness down to the River Welland. Much of Skegness and some parts of Boston, which lies inland, are severely deprived. In the 1630s, Boston lost one tenth of its population when 250 residents departed for a new life in Massachusetts. About 17,500 of the town\u2019s 75,000 residents are foreign citizens, mostly Eastern Europeans working in the agriculture, food processing and packing industries that dominate local employment. The soaring population has put pressure on housing and services. Tory support has been strong, but Labour cut majorities to 515 and just higher in 2001.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mark Simmonds"
"6","81","Bosworth","Bosworth","This Leicestershire seat is named after the small town of Market Bosworth, which is in centre of a large rural area, but its biggest population concentration is in Hinckley. The mining industry that once dominated the economy has long declined and the seat switched to Conservative in 1970. However, a significant number of the working classes and manufacturing industry remains and the Tory margins of victory have not always been great.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Tredinnick"
"7","107","Broxtowe","Broxtowe","Broxtowe forms a corridor between Nottingham and the border with Derbyshire \u2013 with Derby not far to its west. The M1 motorway is the spine of the seat, skirting the urban concentration of Stapleford and Beeston at the south and passing through a more rural area to smaller settlements such as Kimberley at the north. An affluent seat, it has large numbers of professionals and middle classes, with Boots a major employer. It was a notable victory for Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nick Palmer"
"8","136","Charnwood","Charnwood","Curving around the north of Leicester, this seat contains suburbs such as Birstall and Thurmaston at the east and Anstey and Glenfield at the west. The more rural areas further from the city include part of Charnwood Forest. Although the demographic is skewed toward affluent middle-class professionals, skilled working classes who are comfortable are also in abundance. The seat has been Conservative since its creation in 1997.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen  Dorrell"
"9","144","Chesterfield","Chesterfield","A historic market town with a famous crooked church spire, Chesterfield is on the boundary between rural and industrial Derbyshire. It lies to the south of Sheffield and at the heart of the old coalfield. Brimington and Inkersall, to the east, are also included in this seat. Regeneration projects have helped economic diversification and although patches of deprivation remain, the town is now averagely well off, with a large service sector. Once Tony Benn\u2019s parliamentary home, the Liberal Democrats overturned decades of Labour rule with victory in 2001.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Paul Holmes"
"10","161","Corby","Corby","At the northeast end of Northamptonshire, this seat spans over the border with Cambridgeshire, taking in the smaller towns of Oundle, Raunds and Thrapston. Once a steel town, Corby has undergone significant regeneration, but there remains a large Labour-leaning working class, with around a fifth of residents in council accommodation and serious deprivation. It is an economically active seat and also home to a significant middle class in the more affluent countryside. It was held by the Conservatives until 1997.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Phil Hope"
"11","178","Daventry","Daventry","This Northamptonshire seat is barely recognisable from the old one of the same name, having effectively been shifted north under boundary reviews and cut by around 18,000 electors. It includes the Daventry district. Generally an affluent seat, with the exception of a few averagely prosperous areas in Daventry, the seat is home to high numbers of middle-class professionals and the Conservative tradition in the area goes back decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Timothy Boswell"
"12","181","Derby North","Derby_North","A residential seat, it excludes the centre of Derby, but includes a mixture of suburbs. Darley Abbey at the north is relatively affluent, while Chaddesden to the east and Mackworth to the west are less well off. Significant boundary changes have removed the affluent Conservative-leaning Allestree but brought in Mickleover and Littleover. The railway and aerospace industries are big private-sector employers, but new investment has supported a shift from manufacturing to the service sector. Derby University provides a large student population. Labour won this seat from the Tories in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Bob Laxton"
"13","182","Derby South","Derby_South","From Derby city centre, the seat fans out south to suburbs such as Normanton and Alvaston. Boundary changes have removed areas from the west and added Chellaston at the south. Manufacturing, although in decline, remains the centre of the economy and Rolls-Royce is a major employer with a large factory in Sinfin. It is a working-class seat with large numbers of long-term unemployed and those who have never worked. It is also one of the most ethnically diverse in the East Midlands, with about 15 per cent of the population Asian. The seat has been represented by Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Margaret Beckett"
"14","183","Derbyshire Dales","Derbyshire_Dales","This rural seat, which was known as West Derbyshire, stretches from the west of Sheffield, down to the northern fringes of Derby, the famous white peaks of limestone country. Most of the seat is within the Peak District National Park, including Bakewell at the north. The towns of Ashbourne, Matlock and Wirksworth are just outside the park\u2019s boundaries, while several villages are dotted across the area. Tourism and farming are both important in this largely affluent seat, which has been Conservative since 1950 and which is still influenced by the stately homes of Chatsworth and Haddon Hall.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Patrick McLoughlin"
"15","184","Derbyshire Mid","Mid_Derbyshire","This new constituency around the north of Derby has been created from parts of four different seats. Following the River Derwent north from the city, it includes the village of Duffield and busy market town of Belper. Reaching east, it includes the Derby suburb of Oakwood, a large council estate, and villages of Spondon and Borrowash amid semi-rural land. The sought-after modern suburb of Allestree, at the west of the city, is the site of the University of Derby, a notable employer. This seat is generally prosperous and home to affluent professionals.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"16","185","Derbyshire North East","North_East_Derbyshire","This \u2018C-shaped\u2019 constituency surrounds Chesterfield on three sides. Once heavily dependent on mining, former coalfield towns such as Eckington and Killamarsh in the north and Clay Cross in the south are still less affluent than the rural area at the west, or the Sheffield suburb of Dronfield. These areas are home to many commuting professionals who enjoy the scenic location by the edge of the Peak District National Park. Though the seat has been Labour since 1935, margins of victory have sometimes been narrow.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Natascha Engel"
"17","186","Derbyshire South","South_Derbyshire","Skirting around the south of Derby city, this seat stretches down through affluent semi-rural areas to Swadlincote, which was the once centre of the small South Derbyshire coalfield. This area remains less well off and more Labour-leaning but there is no real deprivation and the seat\u2019s residents are economically active. Two manufacturing giants, Toyota and JCB, have bases in the seat, but there is also a strong public sector. Much of the seat is within the National Forest. It has been bellwether since 1970 and once sent Edwina Currie to Parliament.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mark Todd"
"18","241","Erewash","Erewash","Erewash lies between Derby and Nottingham, bounded by the Rivers Trent and Derwent at the south and the River Erewash at the east. Ilkeston is at the north while Sandiacre and Long Eaton flank the M1 motorway, which passes through the south of the seat. Manufacturing is the lynchpin of the economy and though predominantly working class, there are patches of great affluence, especially in the semi-rural southwest. This area has, however, been significantly cut back to accommodate the new Mid Derbyshire seat. It has been Tory since its creation in 1970 until Labour\u2019s victory in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Liz Blackman"
"19","257","Gainsborough","Gainsborough","This vast rural seat north of Lincoln is named after the small market town of Gainsborough at its western boundary. Market Rasen, best known for its racecourse, is the largest town to the east. Regeneration projects are attempting to reduce patches of severe deprivation in Gainsborough, but most of the seat is affluent, albeit isolated. There is an ageing population and though arable farming shapes the landscape, agriculture is in decline and the service sector dominates. The seat was last represented by a non-Conservative MP in 1924.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Edward Leigh"
"20","260","Gedling","Gedling","This densely packed urban seat lies to the east of central Nottingham, with the communities of Arnold, Carlton and Gedling merging to form a large suburban sprawl. The large village of Burton Joyce is to the east. Generally well off, it is a very economically active seat with both middle and working classes well represented. After decades of Conservative dominance it was a notable victory for Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Vernon Coaker"
"21","274","Grantham & Stamford","Grantham_and_Stamford","This southwest Lincolnshire seat is predominantly rural and the towns, both close to the A1, are at its northern and southern extremities. Bourne is the other main town. Grantham, hometown of Margaret Thatcher, has some patches of severe deprivation and is significantly less affluent than the rest of the seat. Manufacturing was traditionally important, while much of the rural land is given over to agriculture, despite employing relatively few. Traditionally a Conservative voting area, it had a Labour MP from 2007 after the defection of Quentin Davies.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Quentin Davies, who defected from the Conservatives."
"22","291","Harborough","Harborough","This Leicestershire seat reaches from Market Harborough on the border with Northamptonshire up through rural land to the densely populated neighbouring towns of Oadby and Wigston, which lie south of Leicester city. This is an economically active seat, with large numbers of professionals and middle-class commuters living in affluent country villages. There is also a sizeable working class, especially in the more deprived Wigston. About 7 per cent of residents are of Indian origin. The seat has been Tory for decades but the Liberal Democrats have worn down majorities in recent elections.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Edward Garnier"
"23","314","High Peak","High_Peak","The Pennines run down the length of the seat, which spans the space between Greater Manchester and Sheffield. Most of it is within the Peak District National Park, with the exception of the settlements at the west, which run between Glossop and Buxton, once famed for its spring waters and now for its opera house. These towns both have significant industry and are Labour-leaning. Overall the seat is very affluent and home to many commuters to the nearby cities. The seat was Tory for 27 years until 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tom Levitt"
"24","341","Kettering","Kettering","Dramatically cut down, the Northamptonshire seat of Kettering has lost a large area of Daventry countryside from its southwest and is more tightly focused around Kettering and the nearby smaller towns of Burton Latimer, Rothwell and Desborough. There are areas of severe deprivation in Kettering. Labour won with a tiny majority of 189 in 1997 and held for two terms before the Conservatives took it back in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Philip Hollobone"
"25","356","Leicester East","Leicester_East","An East Midlands city built around manufacturing, Leicester\u2019s textiles and clothes industries remain important and this seat is overwhelmingly working class. It is also notable as a seat in which white British are a minority, while two-fifths are of Indian origin. The seat covers the Evington, Humberstone, Nether Hall and Rushey Mead areas of the city, including some industrial estates. It has long been seen as a safe Labour seat, although in 1981 its MP defected to the Social Democratic Party and the subsequent split allowed the Tories to win for one term.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Keith Vaz"
"26","357","Leicester South","Leicester_South","From the city centre with its cathedral and covered market, this seat encompasses the University of Leicester and De Montfort universities, with students nearly a fifth of the residents. Farther out are the suburbs of Aylestone, Knighton and Stoneygate. The seat is also notable for a large ethnic minority population at about 40 per cent. About 25 per cent live in social housing. Once seen as a safe Labour seat, it was Conservative from 1983-1987 and even more briefly Liberal Democrat, from a 2004 by-election, until 2005.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Peter Soulsby"
"27","358","Leicester West","Leicester_West","Extending primarily northwest of Leicester centre, this is the most working class of the three seats with a strong manufacturing sector. It includes areas such as New Parks and Beaumont Leys, with residential estates interspersed with industrial parks, recreational sites and a hospital. It is less ethnically diverse than the other two, although still with a sizeable ethnic minority population at around a fifth. The seat has been Labour since the 1920s.","The current MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Patricia Hewitt, who was suspended from the Labour party in March"
"28","359","Leicestershire North West","North_West_Leicestershire","Bordering with Derbyshire, this semi-rural seat contains a large area of the National Forest at its south. The main towns are Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Coalville, while the M1 motorway runs up the east of the seat, passing by East Midlands airport and Castle Donington at the north. This former coalfields seat retains a strong Labour-leaning working class and there are some patches of deprivation, but generally it is well off and also home to sizeable middle classes. It last changed hands in 1997.","The current Labour MP for this seat, David Taylor, died in December."
"29","360","Leicestershire South","South_Leicestershire","The seat formerly known as Blaby has been renamed, reflecting the inclusion of much of the neighbouring Harborough District.  The south of the seat contains the main town of Lutterworth but is generally more rural, while settlements such as Narborough, Blaby and Whetstone are clustered nearer Leicester toward the north. The M1 and M69 motorways run through the seat, converging near the city and the good transport links make it popular with commuters. Once Nigel Lawson\u2019s seat, it has long been Conservative.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew Robothan"
"30","368","Lincoln","Lincoln","Lincoln\u2019s imposing gothic Cathedral towers over the city, with its university and castle. There is a strong working class in Lincoln, although traditional industries have declined and been replaced by retail and public sector. The seat\u2019s boundaries also take in the huge housing estate of Birchwood. Deprivation here and in the north and east of the city contrasts with the more affluent centre and west. Labour\u2019s 1997 victory overturned 18 years of Tory representation in this seat.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Gillian Merron"
"31","377","Loughborough","Loughborough","Midway between Leicester and Nottingham, this seat includes the large town of Loughborough, on the River Soar and Grand Union Canal, and Shepshed, near the M1. To the east it encompasses an area of countryside, with farms and hamlets. The university provides a large student population, at around a fifth. The seat\u2019s demographic is a representative mixture across the social classes, while the economy has an important high-tech sector. Boundary changes in 1997 helped Labour win from the Tories, but minor boundary changes this time were in favour of the Conservatives.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andy Reed"
"32","378","Louth & Horncastle","Louth_and_Horncastle","This large stretch of Lincolnshire coastline includes the seaside resorts of Mablethorpe and Sutton on Sea, where severe deprivation is evident after the decline of the tourism industry. The seat\u2019s eponymous towns lie inland amid a rural area of the Lincolnshire Wolds where farming is an important sector. It is more averagely well off, \u00ad but with a few patches of affluence. The Conservatives have been dominant for decades, but some of the poorest areas supported Labour in 1997.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Peter Tapsell"
"33","390","Mansfield","Mansfield","This Nottinghamshire seat is on the border with Derbyshire. With the exception of the Meden Valley it is predominantly urban and, after boundary changes, includes Warsop to the north, as well as Mansfield and Mansfield Woodhouse. The area suffered with the decline of the coalmines and other manufacturing industries and much of it is severely deprived, with typically high unemployment, low incomes and poor health. It has a long Labour tradition.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Alan Meale"
"34","411","Newark","Newark","A vast rural seat with much of the eastern half of Nottinghamshire, Newark has been slightly redrawn, effectively shifting it to the south, losing Retford to the north but gaining an affluent collection of commuter villages near the small town of Bingham. Newark-on-Trent is near the border with Lincolnshire and has patches of deprivation. A few miles to its west is the more prosperous Southwell, which has its own cathedral. Under its former boundaries it was Labour before 1979, then Conservative until 1997. After one troubled term as Labour MP, Fiona Jones was defeated by the Tories in 2001.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Patrick Mercer"
"35","427","Northampton North","Northampton_North","North of the city centre, this seat is primarily residential but also includes the University of Northampton and several warehousing estates. After boundary changes it lost wards to its southern neighbour. There are areas of deprivation at the east and centre, but this is the more affluent of the two city seats and an above-average working class is balanced by a more prosperous middle class, with the outskirts at the north especially well off. Labour took this traditionally Tory seat in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Sally Keeble"
"36","428","Northampton South","Northampton_South","The newly created seat has removed a substantial affluent rural area to the south as well as the prosperous outskirts of the city. In return it has gained a small industrial area at west of the city, with the net effect of losing about 20,000 electors. With the exception of Duston and Weston, most of this seat is relatively deprived. It encompasses the city centre, Delapre Park, industrial estates and residential suburbs. Under different boundaries, it turned Labour in 1997 but was won back by the Tories in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Brian Binley"
"37","429","Northamptonshire South","South_Northamptonshire","This new seat spans most of the district of the same name, formerly in the Daventry seat, as well as areas up to the south of Northampton. The market towns of Towcester and Brackley are situated amid an expanse of countryside, which reaches almost to Milton Keynes. Silverstone racetrack is also in the seat. This is an affluent area with the number of middle-class professionals above national averages. The working class is also well represented, with few economically inactive. The area has a Conservative tradition stretching back decades.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"38","432","Nottingham East","Nottingham_East","Encompassing the part of Nottingham city centre north of Parliament Street, including the Victoria Shopping Centre, theatres and a campus of Nottingham Trent University, this seat is predominantly suburban. Steinton, towards the racecourse and country park at the east, has areas of severe deprivation, as does St Ann\u2019s, just north of the city centre. Farther north, Sherwood and Mapperley Park are leafier and better off. Labour took this seat from the Tories in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Heppell"
"39","433","Nottingham North","Nottingham_North","This is the most deprived seat in the city. It is mainly working class, two fifths live in social housing, typified by the concentric rings of red-brick homes in Aspley ward, where one area ranked the 26th most deprived out of more than 32,000 nationally in 2007. There tends to be high unemployment and large numbers of residents have never worked. Major economic sectors include manufacturing and health, with a hospital in the seat. With the exception of a narrow Tory victory in 1983, this seat has been Labour since its inception in 1955.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Graham Allen"
"40","434","Nottingham South","Nottingham_South","This seat encompasses most of the pedestrianised areas of the city, Notts County FC, Nottingham University, the Queen\u2019s Medical Centre and affluent residential areas such as Wollaton and Radford to the west of the city centre. Farther south are big industrial parks and Clifton, which has a large council estate and the main university campus. Central and some southern parts of the seat have areas of severe deprivation but this is the wealthiest of the three Nottingham constituencies and is home to a large student population, comprising more than 25 per cent of residents. Labour took it from the Tories in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Alan Simpson"
"41","486","Rushcliffe","Rushcliffe","The southern tip of Nottinghamshire is part of this seat, which was formerly one of the biggest constituencies in terms of population. However, it has lost a substantial area from its northeast including Bingham. Its population is concentrated in the West Bridgford area, on the southern outskirts of Nottingham, while other settlements include Ruddington, Keyworth and East Leake. Both Trent Bridge cricket ground and the City Ground, home to Nottingham Forest FC, are just inside the northern boundary. This is generally an affluent seat, whose Conservative vote has been cemented by the appeal of Ken Clarke, MP since 1970.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Kenneth Clarke"
"42","488","Rutland & Melton","Rutland_and_Melton","This huge rural seat in the East Midlands encompasses the borough of Melton, which has Melton Mowbray at its centre, and the district of Rutland, with the main towns of Oakham and Uppingham.

The main towns lie at opposing ends with Hucknall by the River Leam and Ollerton and Boughton, a former pit town by the River Maun. Most of this old coalfields seat is not well off and has generally voted Labour, although the smaller settlements such as Ravenshead, Calverton and Woodborough are more affluent. The Conservatives held this for one term from 1983.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Paddy Tipping"
"44","514","Sleaford & North Hykeham","Sleaford_and_North_Hykeham","This seat in western Lincolnshire is rural, made up of arable farmland and open space with small settlements. Lincoln is just over the northern border making it easily accessible for affluent commuters. Much of the population lives in North Hykeham and other settlements to the south. The other main town is Sleaford, in the south. Former RAF bases north of Sleaford gave Lincolnshire the nickname \u201cBomber County\u201d during the Second World War. The seat and its predecessors have a long Tory tradition.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Douglas Hogg"

A Georgian market town, it has historic trade links with the Netherlands, and is central to the British flower industry, celebrating with an annual tulip parade.

Typical of farming areas it is averagely affluent, but has long been Conservative.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Hayes"
"46","608","Wellingborough","Wellingborough","This Northamptonshire seat covers not only the eponymous town but also Rushden and Higham Ferrers to its east, towards the border with Bedfordshire. Boundary changes have cut it back, losing the Earls Barton area from its west. This is a seat of contrasts between relatively affluent rural areas and significantly poorer urban areas, with large numbers of working classes and a strong manufacturing sector. Accordingly it has a history of marginality. It was won by Labour with just 187 votes in 1997, and by the Tories by 687 votes in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Peter Bone"

Basildon is the commercial centre of southern Essex and recipient of much Thames Gateway funding including the regeneration of the town centre and development of a new business park. There are areas of severe deprivation within the worst 10 per cent nationwide in Fryerns and Lee Chapel North. While Basildon has been bellwether in recent elections, Billericay is more affluent and strongly Conservative.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Baron"

London Gateway, a container port, is under construction, while the Petroplus refinery remains active. Two of the old seats had Labour MPs, the third a Tory.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Angela Smith"

Unilever and Argos are two of the biggest employers and there is a significant manufacturing sector in the economy. The central urban areas in Castle, Harpur and Cauldwell wards have some severe deprivation while the areas to the north and west such as Putnoe and Brickhill are some of the most affluent. There are notable Italian and Asian populations, mostly concentrated geographically: Queen\u2019s Park ward is more than 45 per cent non-white. Labour took this from the Tories in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Patrick Hall"
"50","42","Bedfordshire Mid","Mid_Bedfordshire","The centre of Bedfordshire is a predominantly rural area, stretching from the outskirts of Milton Keynes at the west across to the border with Hertfordshire at the east. The hills of the Greensand Ridge runs up the west of the seat and the constituency skirts up to the western side of Bedford. The main towns and villages are Ampthill and Flitwick in centre and Shefford and Shillington at east. The M1 motorway cuts through southwest corner of the seat and it is a popular area for affluent commuters. The seat has returned Tory MPs continuously since the Second World War.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nadine Dorries"
"51","43","Bedfordshire North East","North_East_Bedfordshire","This is a big, rural seat that borders with Northamptonshire at the north, arcs to the southeast of Bedford, enclosing the city on three sides and extending south to the border of Hertfordshire. Sandy and Biggleswade are the two main towns, at the east. There is much arable farmland and the area is home to Jordans cereals, while another major employer, Saxon Valley Foods, shut with loss of hundreds of jobs in 2009. This has historically been safe for the Tories.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Alistair Burt"

Leighton-Linslade is often referred to as Leighton Buzzard after the old market town with its shopping mews, but the area of Linslade, on the Grand Union Canal, is notable for its industries. Dunstable and Houghton Regis lie on the outskirts of Luton and have a strong concentration of manufacturing. Towards the Chilterns at the south is Whipsnade Zoo. BE Aerospace is a notable employer in Leighton. This has long been a Tory stronghold.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Andrew Selous"
"53","88","Braintree","Braintree","Effectively shifted north, this Essex seat has gained territory up to the border with Suffolk, formerly in the Saffron Waldon seat, including the town of Halstead. From the south it cedes Witham, which gets its own seat. The southern boundary is now at Braintree, a market town with an ancient town hall. Regeneration projects are improving the two main towns and although the rest of the seat, which is mainly rural, suffers from poor access, the area is generally better off than much of Essex. The seat fell to Labour in 1997 but was regained by the Tories in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Brooks Newmark"

As Britain\u2019s oldest recorded town, it also has several historical attractions from the Norman keep of Colchester Castle to \u201cJumbo\u201d, the Victorian water tower. However, it is not dominated by tourism nor any one industry. An affluent area, it has a mixed economy, with a strong financial and retail sectors and the University of Essex.

The seat is small and mainly urban, including Gorleston to the south. Fishing and manufacturing industries have declined and there is high unemployment, while pockets of severe deprivation exist. There is a large working class and the seat is a base for servicing and supplying the Southern North Sea gas fields. The population is overwhelmingly white and relatively ageing. Once a Tory safe seat, this was one of Labour\u2019s great seaside wins in 1997.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Antony Wright"
"69","292","Harlow","Harlow","Harlow town, at the west of Essex, was built around the original village to house displaced London residents after the Second World War. Although home to one of the UK\u2019s first tower blocks, The Lawn, it is generally green. It has a relatively youthful population and unusually high reliance on large employers. Workplace earnings are significantly higher than residents\u2019, meaning some of the best jobs are taken by those commuting out from London. It has a higher number of ethnic minorities the most of Essex at about 8per cent. It was working-class Tory territory, but Labour took it in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Bill Rammel"

The port is joined with the old, predominantly rural, North Essex seat, which has lost its southwest extremity to the new Witham seat. There are large numbers of pensioners and high levels of deprivation and child poverty. The villages and towns through the countryside inland are more affluent.

Baldock\u2019s Georgian and Victorian buildings contrast with Letchworth \u2013 the first \u201cGarden City\u201d founded in 1903, with further large modern housing estates added through the century.

Radlett and Aldenham are affluent but there are areas of deprivation in Borehamwood. Elstree Studios is a major employer.

Associated manufacturing is a major employment sector, especially in Thetford, where it pays about 50 per cent of the workforce. The decline of agriculture has left Thetford with patches of severe deprivation and it received funding from EU. The seat has been cut by about 16,000 electors, with the loss of the Breckland area around Watton. It has been Conservative since 1964.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Christopher Fraser"
"87","430","Norwich North","Norwich_North","North of the River Wensum, this seat excludes Norwich city centre and instead covers the suburbs of Catton Grove, Crome and Mile Cross, with pockets of severe deprivation in the latter two.

Boundary changes have removed Taverham and Drayton. Under old boundaries a by-election was forced by the resignation of the Labour MP Ian Gibson over his expenses and the seat fell to the Conservatives last year.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Chloe Smith"
"88","431","Norwich South","Norwich_South","Central Norwich, with its Norman cathedral, castle and medieval alleyways, lies in this seat.

It has a stretch of coastline along the Blackwater Estuary. Witham is a small town, with a pleasant Georgian centre but some areas of deprivation, and lies in the centre of the seat by the A12. The rest of the seat is mostly rural with attractive villages such as Coggeshall and Kelvedon. The predecessor seats here tended to return Conservative MPs.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"105","28","Barking","Barking","This East London seat is bounded by the Thames to the south and Barking Creek to the west, with a concentration of industry around the waterfront. The boundary has been extended to include three densely populated wards in the northeast. The ethnic minority population is not large by London standards, with about a fifth of residents. The BNP has increased tensions, especially over access to council housing, where about 40 per cent of residents live, and low-cost housing in new developments from the Thames Gateway project. The seat has been Labour since 1945.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Margaret Hodge"
"106","38","Battersea","Battersea","A long stretch of the Thames from the west side of Wandsworth Bridge almost to Vauxhall Bridge forms the northern boundary of this seat. At its heart are Clapham Junction train station and the Northcote area, home to a large young professional population, with the proportion of those aged between 20 and 29 more than double the national average. Between the train tracks and the river is Battersea Park and Power Station. The seat extends south through Clapham Common to Balham. Labour took this seat from the Tories in 1997 but, by 2005, their majority was just 163 votes.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Martin Linton"
"107","40","Beckenham","Beckenham","Sandwiched between Croydon and Bromley, this quiet and leafy suburban seat has been redrawn and lost Penge wards for the gain of the less populated and more affluent Bromley Common and Hayes and County Hall. Bromley town centre is a mix of mid 20th-century buildings and much older period ones. The population is overwhelmingly white and affluent. The seat has been held by the Tories for decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jacqui Lait"
"108","49","Bermondsey & Old Southwark","Bermondsey_and_Old_Southwark","This inner London seat spans the south bank of the Thames from Blackfriars Bridge to Greenland Docks. It includes Borough and Bankside, Bermondsey and Rotherhithe. There are some sought-after riverside properties but the seat has large areas of deprivation. The Elephant & Castle area and the Heygate estate are undergoing much-needed regeneration. There is a large student population and about 15 per cent of residents are black-African. More than 50 per cent live in social housing. Labour lost this seat to the Liberal Democrats in a 1982 by-election and have never regained it.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Simon Hughes"
"109","52","Bethnal Green & Bow","Bethnal_Green_and_Bow","Brick Lane, famous for its art scene and curry houses, runs up the west of this inner London seat through Banglatown and Spitalfields where the majority of residents are Bangladeshi. The seat includes Bethnal Green, Stepney Green and Whitechapel and extends east to Mile End and Bow. It is generally deprived, with about 80 per cent social housing in some areas. The seat has been slightly reduced and no longer contains St Katherine\u2019s, Wapping or Shadwell. A traditional Labour stronghold, Respect capitalised on the anti-war vote for a dramatic win in 2005.","The current Respect MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is George Galloway"
"110","55","Bexleyheath & Crayford","Bexleyheath_and_Crayford","This seat is the easternmost London area south of the river Thames. Bexleyheath, at its west, is the main shopping hub. Crayford, farther east, is being regenerated having become run-down with vacant industrial sites. The seat curves up at the northeast to a small stretch of riverbank where Slade Green is one of the more deprived areas in what is otherwise a well-off seat. Relatively minor boundary changes do not significantly alter this seat, which was won by Labour on its creation in 1997, but taken by the Tories in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Evennett"
"111","90","Brent Central","Brent_Central","This new seat merges the remnant parts of the old Brent South and Brent East. Kensal Green lies at the southeast, neighbouring Stonebridge and Harlesden, which have a high concentration of black residents and severe deprivation. The southwest corner is dominated by the Park Royal industrial estate, the largest in Europe. To the west is Wembley Stadium, while the north reaches to Dollis Hill, through more areas of deprivation in Willesden Green and Neasden, which has Britain\u2019s largest Hindu temple. The Liberal Democrats took Brent East from Labour in a 2003 by-election and held on in 2005.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Dawn Butler"
"112","91","Brent North","Brent_North","With leafy residential streets of mid-war semis in Northwick Park and Kenton and bordering on Harrow to the west, this is the more affluent half of Brent. However, there are still areas of deprivation, especially in the south and centre. Brent has a majority non-white population and there is a large number of Asian residents concentrated in Queensbury and around Wembley. Boundary changes have extended it substantially at the south to include Alperton. The old seat was Tory from its creation in 1974 until it fell to Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Barry Gardiner"
"113","92","Brentford & Isleworth","Brentford_and_Isleworth","Through the heart of this West London seat is Brentford and Isleworth. It also extends west to include most of Hounslow and east to Chiswick, with the northern boundary loosely following the M4. A seat of contrasts, Osterley Park and Chiswick Riverside have some affluent areas, but Brentford has pockets of deprivation that rank nationally among the worst 10 per cent. Central Hounslow is undergoing regeneration with the \u00a3220 million Blenheim Centre. Brentford is also home to GlaxoSmithKline. The Tories held this seat from its creation in 1974 until Labour took it in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ann Keen"
"114","104","Bromley & Chislehurst","Bromley_and_Chislehurst","Although now technically a London borough, Bromley bears much resemblance to Kent to which it once belonged. It is the largest borough town, with the Glades Shopping Centre and a pedestrianised high street. It is one of the least deprived areas in London. About 30 per cent of the borough\u2019s residents work in Bromley town, which has a mixed service sector economy. This seat has lost Bromley Common but gained the Cray Valley West ward, where there is some manufacturing. The seat has long been held by the Tories, but a 2006 by-election left them with a narrow majority.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Bob Neill"
"115","117","Camberwell & Peckham","Camberwell_and_Peckham","Previously the smallest English seat in terms of electorate, this Southwark constituency gains the South Camberwell ward and parts of Livesey and Peckham Rye. The huge Aylesbury estate in Walworth struggles to shake off its reputation for urban decay but has recently received funding. This has improved living standards and the buildings will be replaced within the next 15 years. Camberwell Green and Peckham both have pockets of severe deprivation. About 40 per cent of residents are black, predominantly of African heritage. About two thirds of residents live in social housing. The seat has been Labour since 1945.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Harriet Harman"
"116","133","Carshalton & Wallington","Carshalton_and_Wallington","On the southern fringe of London, this seat is between South Croydon and Sutton. There are above-average numbers of workers in construction industries and pockets of deprivation around the St Helier estate and parts of South Beddington to the east. The south of the borough, around Carshalton Beeches, is more affluent, with large 1920s and 1930s detached houses and more rural expanses towards Clock House. The Liberal Democrats took this from the Tories in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tom Brake"
"117","140","Chelsea & Fulham","Chelsea_and_Fulham","This new seat unites these two affluent areas on the north bank of the Thames. Fulham lies at the southwest and Chelsea at the northeast. The King\u2019s Road runs the length of the seat and is the retail and entertainment focus. House prices are high and the borough lives up to its wealthy reputation, although a small area of Fulham Broadway, traditionally a more working-class area, is in the worst 10 per cent for deprivation nationwide. The old Kensington and Chelsea seat was Tory, while Hammersmith and Fulham was held by Labour for two terms from 1997 to 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Greg Hands"
"118","146","Chingford & Woodford Green","Chingford_and_Woodford_Green","This North London seat covers borough boundaries. The Woodford Green area, from Redbridge at the east, includes the affluent, tree-lined streets of Monkhams. Chingford at the west is comfortably well off and forms the more prosperous northern half of Waltham Forest Borough. Essentially white suburbia, Winston Churchill once held a seat here on old boundaries and, under Norman Tebbit and Iain Duncan Smith, it remained a Tory stronghold.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Iain Duncan Smith"
"119","148","Chipping Barnet","Chipping_Barnet","In the north of London, High Barnet is the last stop on the Northern Line. Surrounded by affluent residential streets of 1930s semi-detached houses, the seat has some deprived areas in the Underhill ward. The west and north of the seat gives way to fields, with the village of Totteridge among them. Totteridge Lane, overlooking farmland, has some of the highest house prices in the capital. To the south the seat has been extended to include all of Coppetts ward, including Friern Village, a luxury development popular with celebrities. The seat has been Tory since 1950.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Theresa Villiers"
"120","151","Cities of London & Westminster","Cities_of_London_and_Westminster","This seat stretches from Hyde Park at the west, across to the banking and financial hub of the City in the east, and is bounded to the south by the Thames. It includes landmarks such as Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament, retail centres such as Oxford Street and the entertainment districts of Soho, Covent Garden and the Strand. Only two small areas of deprivation exist, in the Churchill ward to the south, and around Chinatown, which is home to one of the largest Chinese populations in Britain. This is seen as a safe Tory seat.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mark Field"
"121","170","Croydon Central","Croydon_Central","Reduced in size, this seat retains the retail centre of Croydon, which is based around the Whitgift shopping precinct. It extends southeast to the New Addington housing estate, which, along with the Ashburton area, is deprived. The rest of the centre is relatively affluent. Croydon has the highest levels of inequality of any London borough. Croydon\u2019s skyline has many high-rise buildings, including the tower housing Nestle, a notable employer. Labour took this seat from the Tories in 1997 but lost it  in 2005. Andrew Pelling lost the Tory whip in 2007 and then sat as an independent.","The current Independent MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew Pelling, who had the Tory whip withdrawn in 2007"
"122","171","Croydon North","Croydon_North","This residential seat to the north of Croydon town centre borders with Lambeth and is more typical of London than the other Croydon seats. It is less affluent, with notable deprivation, especially in the Broad Green area. It is ethnically diverse, with white British a minority. More than a fifth of residents are black and about 15 per cent are Indian or Pakistani. Many of these are first generation, with more than 30 per cent of residents born outside Britain. Labour took this seat from the Tories in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Malcolm Wicks"
"123","172","Croydon South","Croydon_South","Only the southern fringes of Croydon are in this seat and the Waddon area is one of the few areas of deprivation. Most of the seat is really Purley and Coulsdon with suburban areas reaching down to the Surrey border. There are above-average numbers of people in professional and managerial jobs, although Purley Way is known for warehousing and retail parks. It is the least ethnically diverse of the Croydon boroughs, at 80 per cent white British and with no other single ethnic group exceeding 4 per cent. This seat has been held by the Tories for decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Richard Ottoway"
"124","175","Dagenham & Rainham","Dagenham_and_Rainham","Dagenham\u2019s name is synonymous with the Ford Motor plant in the south of the seat, which now produces only car parts. The seat has been effectively shifted east under boundary changes, losing three working class urban wards from the west but gaining three much larger, greener and more middle class Tory wards from Havering Borough in the southeast. There are patches of severe deprivation dotted through the seat, especially in the centre and the west, and the BNP has had most success in those areas. The old Dagenham seat was Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jon Cruddas"
"125","206","Dulwich & West Norwood","Dulwich_and_West_Norwood","This South London seat, straddling the Lambeth-Southwark borough border, contains areas of contrasting affluence. Coldharbour, one of Brixton\u2019s most notorious areas and now included in this seat, is in the worst 10 per cent for deprivation nationwide, with estates such as Angell Town and Moorlands. But the Thurlow Park and the leafy Dulwich area are at the opposite end. Dulwich is home to several prestigious independent schools. Labour took this seat from the Tories in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tessa Jowell"
"126","218","Ealing Central & Acton","Ealing_Central_and_Acton","Based on the old Ealing, Acton & Shepherd\u2019s Bush seat, which straddled borough borders, this new seat has lost the Shepherd\u2019s Bush area. It has been extended west to include the centre of Ealing, with the affluent area around Ealing Broadway Tube and common. Acton is at the east and is less prosperous. The north of the seat contains some of the Park Royal industrial estate. The old seat was won by Labour in 1997, but the Ealing area previously had a Tory MP.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew Slaughter"
"127","219","Ealing North","Ealing_North","This seat includes Hanwell, with its 1930s semis, and the residential suburb of Perivale, which includes an industrial estate and the distinctive Art Deco Hoover Building (now Tesco). Both of these areas are affluent and the Greenford area is also comfortably well off. In Northolt, however, more than 30 per cent of residents have no skills and there are areas of severe deprivation. Ealing is home to the largest Polish community in London, with 21,000 in the borough given national insurance numbers between 2002 and April 2008. This has tended to be a bellwether seat.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen Pound"
"128","220","Ealing Southall","Ealing__Southall","Reduced in size, the seat has lost more than 20,000 electors, with chunks towards Central Ealing cut, but well-off residential areas such as Northfield and Elthorne gained. The seat\u2019s focus is Southall, to the west, known as \u201cLittle India\u201d, which has the biggest Indian population in London, as well as a notable Pakistani population. Its bustling streets are known for vibrant bazaars. Southall has a skills shortage with about 30 per cent of working-age residents having no qualifications and large areas among the 10 per cent most deprived nationwide. The seat has returned Labour MPs for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Virendra Sharma, who won the 2007 by-election following the death of Piara Khabra"
"129","222","East Ham","East_Ham","This East London seat has been extended with the gain of the large, if sparsely populated, Royal Docks area along the Thames, which has been regenerated with conference venues such as ExCel. Its other main areas are Beckton, East Ham, Upton Park and Little Ilford, all with large areas of relative deprivation. Newham is the most ethnically diverse local authority in Britain. The Asian population is concentrated in the north of the seat, comprising about two thirds in Green Street and East Ham North, where the white population is 16 per cent. This seat has a solid Labour tradition.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen Timms"
"130","233","Edmonton","Edmonton","The distinctive social housing blocks of Edmonton Green rise up above its shopping centre, looking out over North London. The area bordering Tottenham to the south shares its deprived characteristic, as does the newly included Ponders End ward to the north. The seat is bounded by reservoirs, manufacturing and warehouses to the east, but the western end around Bush Hill Park is much more affluent, with leafy residential streets. The seat is ethnically diverse, with a notable Cypriot community. From 1983 to 1997 the Tories interrupted Labour\u2019s dominance of this seat.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andy Love"
"131","236","Eltham","Eltham","Just south of Greenwich and Woolwich, this South London seat is generally more affluent than its riverside neighbours, from which it gains a couple of wards after boundary changes. At the west of the seat, however, there are areas in the 10 per cent most deprived nationally. About 30 per cent of residents live in social housing. Eltham Palace and the town centre have distinctive historical architecture. The south and east of the seat border with Bexley borough and share more of its suburban characteristics. Labour took this from the Tories in a 1997 landslide.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Clive Efford"
"132","237","Enfield North","Enfield_North","This is the northernmost constituency in London, its outer boundary following the M25, which separates it from Hertfordshire. A large area of greenbelt open park and farmland covers the north and west of the seat, while the southern boundary cuts through Enfield town centre. The east, around Enfield Lock, has more industrial heritage and more deprived areas. Labour took this seat from the Tories in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Joan Ryan"
"133","238","Enfield Southgate","Enfield__Southgate","The western end of Enfield borough, bordering Barnet, is the most affluent, particularly in the large areas of green space around Cockfosters. It is typified by wide leafy residential streets with semi-detached houses. The few, small patches of deprivation lie at south, on the border with Haringey. This seat was scene of the more memorable victory of the 1997 election, when Michael Portillo was ousted from what had been a safe Tory seat for decades. His replacement, Stephen Twigg, was then a major scalp for the Tories in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Davis Burrowes"
"134","242","Erith & Thamesmead","Erith_and_Thamesmead","This riverside seat straddles two London boroughs: the former \u201cnew town\u201d of Thamesmead at the west of the seat is from Greenwich, while Erith and surroundings at the east of the seat from Bexley. About 30 per cent of residents live in social housing and areas in Thamesmead are in the most deprived 10 per cent nationwide. These give way to warehouses in Belvedere, the second largest manufacturing area in the capital. The Thames Gateway project aims to regenerate to the area. About 25 per cent are ethnic minorities. Labour took this seat on its creation in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Austin"
"135","248","Feltham & Heston","Feltham_and_Heston","The name of the seat reflects two relatively distinct areas flanking Heathrow airport, which has a massive influence on the local economy. Heston and Cranford lie to its east, under the main flight path and bisected by the M4, and Feltham, Bedfont and Hanworth, to the airport\u2019s south. Hanworth has some particularly deprived areas such as the Butts Farm estate, while Bedfont Lakes is a commercial base for companies such as IBM.

"136","252","Finchley & Golders Green","Finchley_and_Golders_Green","Golders Green, at the south of this seat, is renowned for its Jewish community, which makes up about a fifth of the population with especially high numbers of Orthodox Jews. Hampstead Garden Suburb, founded by Dame Henrietta Barnett in 1907, is the most affluent ward in Barnet, with its sought-after architecture. Farther northeast, however, there are concentrations of council housing in East Finchley. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s seat from 1959 to 1992, it notably turned Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Rudi Vis"
"137","278","Greenwich & Woolwich","Greenwich_and_Woolwich","All but one of the wards in this marginally redrawn seat have areas in 10 per cent of the most deprived in the country. These are concentrated around Woolwich at the east, which has not recovered from the closure of the old Royal Arsenal. At the other end of the seat, Greenwich Village has relatively affluent areas along with the Cutty Sark and Royal Observatory. Thames Gateway regeneration is needed and the peninsula is scene of one of the biggest housing projects with the Millennium Village. The seat has been a Labour stronghold for years.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nick Raynsford"
"138","280","Hackney North & Stoke Newington","Hackney_North_and_Stoke_Newington","This inner London seat includes large areas of severe deprivation as well as the up-and-coming Stoke Newington, popular with young professionals. It is diverse, with less than half of the residents white British: about a fifth are black, concentrated in the south of the seat, and there is a significant Indian population in the east. There is religious diversity, too, with a large Muslim population and a notable Turkish community. The seat has been Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Diane Abbott"

Although many tower blocks have been demolished, more than half live in social housing. Further regeneration is coming with the Olympic Village, a third of which lies inside the seat\u2019s eastern boundary.

The seat includes some deprived areas, with 45 per cent of residents in College Park and Old Oak renting from housing association. The old Hammersmith and Fulham seat was taken by the Tories in 2005, while the Shepherd\u2019s Bush area was previously in a Labour seat.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"141","290","Hampstead & Kilburn","Hampstead_and_Kilburn","After significant boundary changes, leafy Hampstead with its Victorian terraces is no longer paired with Highgate to its northeast. Instead, it gains a chunk of neighbouring Brent borough to the southwest, encompassing Brondesbury, with its large detached houses, Queen\u2019s Park and Kilburn, which includes an area of deprivation in an otherwise affluent seat. Traditionally home to many Irish residents, there are a mix of ethnicities. The other centres from Camden borough are Swiss Cottage and Belsize.

The area is fairly affluent commuter territory and deprivation is low. This seat has swung between the two main parties and was taken by Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tony  McNulty"
"143","295","Harrow West","Harrow_West","After boundary changes this northwest London seat loses the large Pinner area, and gains more of Harrow at the east. With several Tube stops in the seat, most residents commute to work elsewhere and it is generally affluent.

Once described by George Orwell as \u201cone of the most godforsaken places I have ever struck\u201d, Hayes is predominantly a residential suburb with industrial sites and has little in the way of cultural assets. A number of Hayes areas are within the most deprived 20 per cent nationwide. This seat historically returned Labour MPs, but was held by the Tories from 1983-1997 before Labour recaptured it.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John McDonnell"
"145","304","Hendon","Hendon","The M1 motorway runs the length of this North London seat, from the green spaces by the border with Hertfordshire, finishing at Brent Cross at the southern boundary. Burnt Oak and Colindale, on the western border, are the poorest areas, and along with West Hendon have large council housing concentrations.

Retaining its old name, this redrawn seat extends farther north to include Gospel Oak and the affluent Highgate.

"147","317","Hornchurch & Upminster","Hornchurch_and_Upminster","The two old seats that give their name to this new one have not fared equally, with almost all of the old Upminster territory included, but only two wards from Hornchurch. These include the town centre of Hornchurch, which, like Cranham and Upminster, are prosperous. There are some patches of deprivation at the north of the seat. The easternmost point in London, and the end of the District Line, this seat feels more like Essex, with which it borders. Both the predecessor seats here switched to Labour in 1997, with Upminster going back to the Tories in 2001 and Hornchurch in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Angela Watkinson"

Hornsey, one of the more diverse wards, is\u00a0the focus of\u00a0significant Turkish, Greek, Cypriot and black communities.

It includes part of Woodford in the west, separated by the M11 motorway from the rest of the seat, encompassing Clayhill, Fairlop and Hainault in the east.

There are patches of deprivation, but few residents live in social housing and most of the seat is averagely well off. Under varying electoral boundaries it has changed hands from Labour to Conservative frequently.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Mike Gapes"

Dotted with cosmopolitan areas such as Portobello Road, with its famous market, the north has deprived areas, as is the western boundary around Earl\u2019s Court. The centre, south and east are affluent. Notting Hill has been gentrified but retains its diversity, celebrated in the carnival every year.

"154","343","Kingston & Surbiton","Kingston_and_Surbiton","The main retail centre of Kingston-upon-Thames, with the large Bentalls shop and old market square, are at the northern boundary of this seat. Farther east is New Malden, which has the largest Korean population in Europe. In the centre of the seat lies Surbiton, while at the south is Chessington, known for its theme park. The area is generally well off, with only one small area of Norbiton in the 20 per cent most deprived nationally. The Lib Dems took this traditionally Tory seat in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Edward Davey"
"155","363","Lewisham Deptford","Lewisham__Deptford","This is the most deprived of the seats in the southeast London borough of Lewisham, partly because of the legacy of the dock closures at Deptford. Efforts to regenerate as part of the Thames Gateway area are underway along with new transport links. The seat is primarily residential, with many commuting out to work, and about 40 per cent living in social housing. There are more affluent areas around Crofton Park and Hilly Fields. About a third of residents are black. The seat has long returned Labour MPs.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Joan Ruddock"
"156","364","Lewisham East","Lewisham_East","This southeast London seat focuses on Catford and stretches north to Blackheath. Pockets of deprivation are significantly concentrated in Whitefoot, Downham and Rushey Green, which, along with Catford South, is included after boundary changes. About 30 per cent of the seat\u2019s residents live in social housing. The seat had been Tory from 1983 until 1992, when Labour took it.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Bridget Prentice"
"157","365","Lewisham West & Penge","Lewisham_West_and_Penge","The new name for this seat reflects significant boundary changes, which effectively shift it southwest, gaining Penge, Crystal Palace and Clock House. The latter two and the Lewisham ward of Bellingham have areas of severe deprivation. Across the seat about 30 per cent live in social housing. This is mainly a residential seat with some manufacturing in Sydenham. Labour took this from the Tories in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jim Dowd"
"158","366","Leyton & Wanstead","Leyton_and_Wanstead","Straddling borough boundaries, this East London seat combines deprived areas around Leyton, from Waltham Forest at the west, with the better-off Wanstead area, from Redbridge at the east. It is ethnically diverse with the biggest minority groups Pakistani and black Caribbean. It is also economically varied with both numbers of professionals and of those who have never worked above the London average. The seat has been Labour since its creation in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Harry Cohen"
"159","399","Mitcham & Morden","Mitcham_and_Morden","The Underground passes through Collier\u2019s Wood at the north of the seat and terminates in Morden, but the Tube station and town centre are just over the boundary in the neighbouring Wimbledon seat. It includes a small portion of the 1930s St Helier housing estate and is less affluent than its western neighbour. It has pockets of deprivation in Figges Marsh. It is also more diverse, with black and ethnic minority populations at 50 per cent in some wards and Sri Lankan, South African and Polish communities. The seat reaches southwest as far as Lower Morden and east to Mitcham Common, both more prosperous areas. Labour unseated the Tories here in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Siobhain McDonagh"
"160","438","Old Bexley & Sidcup","Old_Bexley_and_Sidcup","This suburban southeast London seat reaches almost to Dartford and is  dominated by rows of 1930s semi-detached houses, the vast majority of which are owner-occupied. The Coca-Cola plant in Sidcup is a notable employer and the majority of working people in Bexley do not leave the borough. St Mary\u2019s is the most affluent part of a well-off seat. It was held by Ted Heath for 14 terms and remained Tory. It has been represented by an independent since 2008 after Derek Conway had the whip removed over his expenses.","The current Independent MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Derek Conway, who had the Conservative whip removed."
"161","442","Orpington","Orpington","This seat has been reduced and Orpington lies towards the north of the seat. The boundaries stretch south through rural areas to Biggin Hill, home of the airport, stopping short of the M25. Technically in the London borough of Bromley, it is often thought of as Kent. It is well off and more than 90 per cent white British. The seat has been Tory since 1970.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Horam"
"162","456","Poplar & Limehouse","Poplar_and_Limehouse","Poplar used to be twinned with Canning Town, to the east, but has been cut back, gaining a much smaller area to the west, extending as far as St Katherine Docks and the News International base at Wapping. The south of the seat follows the Thames through Shadwell to Limehouse, which includes the most deprived area in London. Just a short way southeast is Canary Wharf. To the south the seat includes the Isle of Dogs and north it reaches to Bromley by Bow, which has high levels of social housing. Labour has historically been strong in this area.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jim Fitzpatrick"
"163","462","Putney","Putney","The sought-after Putney area lies along a small stretch of river at the west of Wandsworth and is home to many professionals. Roehampton, farther east, has its own university. The A3 cuts through the seat; at its south is Putney Heath and Southfields, reaching down to the top of Wimbledon Park.

It was won by Labour in 1997, but retaken by the Tories in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Justine Greening"
"164","473","Richmond Park","Richmond_Park","The vast expanse of the park dominates the centre of seat with the urban areas concentrated either side. At the north are the affluent centres of Richmond, Barnes and Kew, with the Royal Botanical Gardens, all by the Thames. At the south is Coombe and the residential northern half of Kingston-upon-Thames. The private Coombe Estate has multimillion pound homes but the rest of Coombe is more affordable and diverse. The Lib Dems took this from the Tories in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Susan Kramer"
"165","477","Romford","Romford","Romford is technically at the northeastern fringe of London, but is thought of as Essex. It is overwhelmingly white and well off, with above-average numbers of owner-occupiers and self-employed. Under boundary changes it lost part of Emerson Park but took the populated Hylands, from the western edge of Hornchurch. The northern end of the seat includes Collier Row and Havering Country Park. Labour overturned 23 years of Tory representation to take this in 1997, but the Tories won it back in 2001.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew Rosindell"
"166","484","Ruislip, Northwood & Pinner","Ruislip__Northwood_and_Pinner","On northwestern fringe of London, bordering with Buckinghamshire to the west and Hertfordshire to the north. This seat has been substantially redrawn to take in Pinner at the northeast, from Harrow borough, and Ickenham at the southwest from the old Uxbridge seat. It lost Manor, South Ruislip and Cavendish from the southeast. Its affluent residential areas have good transport links with several Underground and overground stations. This has been safely Tory for decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nick Hurd"
"167","544","Streatham","Streatham","From the eastern half of Clapham Common this seat stretches down to Streatham in the south, taking in large African and Caribbean communities in a seat where 30 per cent were born outside Britain. Less affluent than the other Lambeth constituencies, there are sought-after residential areas around the Abbeville Road area and along the edges of Tooting Bec Common. Like much of South London, it also has pockets of severe deprivation, especially in Brixton Hill and Knight\u2019s Hill. About 30 per cent live in social housing. Labour took this seat from the Tories in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Keith Hill"
"168","556","Sutton & Cheam","Sutton_and_Cheam","Technically part of London, this seat has more in common with Surrey, which it borders. Predominantly white, with no major ethnic groups, this is a generally affluent seat with only small numbers of residents in social housing and above-average numbers in managerial or professional occupations. Cheam and Belmont are often referred to as villages, with affluent residential streets, while Sutton has a pedestrianised retail centre. At the north of the seat, Kempton is a more industrial area and around Rosehill is less affluent. The Lib Dems took this from the Tories in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Paul Burstow"
"169","574","Tooting","Tooting","Sandwiched between Wimbledon and Streatham, this South London seat boasts green spaces at Wandsworth and Tooting Bec Commons. Earlsfield and Tooting are the main centres and the rest of the seat has residential streets built in the 1930s. Fairly well off, it is less affluent and more ethnically diverse than the other Wandsworth seats. More than 30 per cent live in social housing and there are notable Indian and black Caribbean communities. It has returned Labour since its creation in 1974","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Sadiq Kahn"
"170","578","Tottenham","Tottenham","This North London seat, stretching from Finsbury Park to White Hart Lane, encompasses the poorer and more deprived eastern half of Haringey. It is a densely populated Labour stronghold with high unemployment and large areas of deprivation, especially in the northeast. Manufacturing remains an important sector but is in decline. There is a large black population and other ethnic minority groups including Turkish and Cypriot. This has been safely Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for this seat is David Lammy"

Other population centres are Hampton at the west and Teddington at the east, with its canal and locks. Hampton Court Palace and park, and Bushy Park, cover the south of the seat.

The seat is generally affluent and was Tory from the Second World War until 1997, when the Lib Dems took it.","The current Lib Dem MP for this seat is Vincent Cable"
"172","587","Uxbridge & Ruislip South","Uxbridge_and_South_Ruislip","On the western edge of London, the old Uxbridge seat has been redrawn with Ickenham lost from the northwest and West Drayton from the south. However, it has gained a large chunk of Manor, South Ruislip and Cavendish at the northeast, divided from the main Uxbridge town and Hillingdon by the RAF Northolt. Brunel University is a major presence and employer in the area. Bordering with Buckinghamshire, it is well connected and part of the affluent commuter belt. The old Uxbridge seat had been Tory since 1970.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Randall"
"173","590","Vauxhall","Vauxhall","From the north side of Clapham Common, the seat tracks the A3 north through Stockwell and Vauxhall as far as Oval, then follows the riverside from Vauxhall Bridge to the Southbank. It is a seat of contrasts with affluent areas in Clapham Old Town and Thames-side residences backing on to housing estates with severe deprivation. About half of the residents lived in social housing at the last census, but it has lost the deprived Coldharbour ward. There are large black African and Caribbean communities and more than 30 per cent of residents were born outside Britain. The seat has been Labour since 1983.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Kate Hoey"
"174","595","Walthamstow","Walthamstow","This East London seat was made famous by the band East 17, while its dog track was one of the last in London. Its reputation as the traditional working-class southern half of Waltham Forest is not undeserved, with patches of severe deprivation. It is a diverse area with about half of residents white British, and large Pakistani, Caribbean and African populations. Clement Attlee once held a seat under old boundaries, and Labour have traditionally been strong.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Neil Gerrard"
"175","614","West Ham","West_Ham","This diverse seat in inner London has been enlarged to include Canning Town and Custom House, a large area at the southwest with parts that are within the most deprived 10 per cent nationwide. The rest of the seat is slightly more affluent although Stratford is undergoing regeneration with most of the Olympic Village based there. The largest Asian populations are concentrated around Green Street at the east of the seat. It also includes Plaistow, while West Ham FC\u2019s stadium is just over the boundary in the neighbouring East Ham seat. The seat has been safely Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Lyn Brown"
"176","615","Westminster North","Westminster_North","This new London seat is based on the Westminster borough parts of the old Regent\u2019s Park & Kensington North seat. Its western boundary spans from Queen\u2019s Park to Lancaster Gate while the eastern edge is Regent\u2019s Park. There is variety of affluence in this residential seat. Most of the south and west is in the most deprived 5 per cent nationwide, while the St John\u2019s Wood area at the north is home to celebrities. The old seat had been held by Labour from 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Karen Buck"
"177","621","Wimbledon","Wimbledon","Famous for the All England Lawn Tennis Club, Wimbledon has two main areas, with the most affluent Wimbledon Village and the main town area, with the Centre Court Shopping Centre. Well connected with several mainline rail stations and two Underground lines, Wimbledon is popular with commuters and primarily residential. The centres of Morden, Raynes Park and West Barnes are also in this seat. Labour overturned decades of Tory representation with their win here in 1997 but lost it back in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen Hammond"
"178","50","Berwick-upon-Tweed","Berwick-upon-Tweed","The market town of Berwick-upon-Tweed lies just north of the river that forms the traditional border with Scotland; English for now, it has changed hands many times, often through battles. The huge Northumberland seat includes such attractions as the Holy Island of Lindisfarne, Alnwick Castle \u2013 used as Hogwarts in Harry Potter films \u2013beautiful Alnwick coast, Cheviot Hills and spectacular rolling moors of Northumberland National Park. The seat has high numbers of self-employed, middle classes and low-wage rural workers. A Lib Dem safe seat, it was previously Conservative.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Alan Beith"
"179","66","Bishop Auckland","Bishop_Auckland","Its southwestern expanse of Co Durham borders Cumbria at the west and is primarily rural Teesdale, with moors, commons and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The key town, in the middle, is Barnard Castle, on the banks of the Tees, home to a boarding school that produced several England Rugby Union internationals, including the Underwood brothers. While most of the area is well-off, the urban concentration at the northeastern extremity \u2013 Bishop Auckland, Shildon and Spennymoor \u2013 have areas of deprivation. This seat has been staunchly Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Helen Goodman"
"180","72","Blaydon","Blaydon","From the town of Birtley and the iconic Angel of the North at the east, this seat encompasses the fringes of Gateshead, including part of the Team Valley industrial area. It extends west, taking in the huge Metrocentre shopping precinct and the towns of Whickham, Ryton and Blaydon; the 19th century folk song Blaydon Races is Tyneside&apos;s unofficial anthem. The southern and western fringes of the seat are more rural. The seat has been Labour since 1935.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Dave Anderson"
"181","73","Blyth Valley","Blyth_Valley","This densely populated urban seat lies on the coast just north of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The two main population centres are Blyth, whose port handles 1.5 million tonnes of cargo each year and whose football team, Blyth Spartans, is famous for its giant-killing FA Cup exploits, and Cramlington, a former village which expanded rapidly after being designated as a new town in the 1960s. It has not fully recovered from the decline of the coalmining industry. The seat has a strong Labour tradition, though victories over the SDP in the 1980s were sometimes slim.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Ronnie Campbell"
"182","176","Darlington","Darlington","The large market town of Darlington, birthplace of the railways, lies at the south of Co Durham, to the west of Middlesbrough. It has several large industrial parks and a larger-than-average construction sector. Main employers include the council, the hospital and Orange. The town centre has areas of deprivation. The seat is well connected: the A1(M) skirts its north-west. It has changed hands a number of times postwar, most recently switching to Labour in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Alan Milburn"
"183","214","Durham, City of","City_of_Durham","Built on a loop of the River Wear, the small city of Durham boasts cobbled streets, a prestigious university and a Unesco World Heritage Site enclosing cathedral and castle. Rural areas surrounding it feature farms and woodland. Former mining settlements such as Sherburn to the east and Brandon to the west suffered with the decline of mining. Newton Hall, in the north, was once the largest housing estate in Europe. There are large student and elderly populations. Recently Lib Dems slashed the majorities in this once-certain Labour seat.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Roberta Blackman-Woods"
"184","215","Durham North","North_Durham","This relatively small seat between Durham and Sunderland is densely populated, with its chief towns of Chester-le-Street at the east and Stanley at the west. Both have areas of severe deprivation. The former\u2019s Riverside cricket stadium is the home of Durham CCC and recently hosted England one-day internationals and Test matches. Annfield Plain and smaller former pit villages are dotted through moorland and fells. The A1M and East Coast mainline running through the seat, which is solidly Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Kevan Jones"
"185","216","Durham North West","North_West_Durham","This large seat is mostly remote moorland, with occasional hamlets and arable farming. The main settlements are in the east and fairly deprived: the former steel-working town of Consett, at the north; the market town of Crook; and the former pit town of Willington, at the foot of the Pennines in the south, with Tow Law between. Other communities, such as the small town of Stanhope, are better off and line the banks of the Wear. This has long been a Labour seat.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Hilary Armstrong"
"186","221","Easington","Easington","From Seaham in the north, the seat stretches down the coast as far as Blackhall Colliery, with Peterlee, a new town built in 1948, slightly inland. Lying between Tyne and Wear to the north and Tees Valley to the south, it enjoys their good rail and road links. Its economy and many communities were devastated by the closure of pits that employed over half its men in the early 1980s. It has not yet recovered, with severe deprivation in much of the seat. Unsurprisingly, it is safely Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Cummings"
"187","259","Gateshead","Gateshead","This new dense urban seat reaches from Dunston in the west to Felling in the east, with Gateshead in the middle. Residents live in a mix of terraced housing, densely packed maisonettes and tower blocks. Though there are large areas of deprivation, regeneration on the south bank of the Tyne has created a cultural quarter that includes the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art and the Sage Gateshead music complex, designed by Lord Foster of Thames Bank. The area has a long Labour heritage.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"188","296","Hartlepool","Hartlepool","The northeastern coastal town of Hartlepool, developed around the port and distinctive headland, was traditionally known for shipbuilding and steel. Though a shadow of their old selves, significant manufacturing and construction centres remain. Warehousing and industries dominate much of the coast along Hartlepool Bay and there is a nuclear power station. Most of this working-class town remains severely deprived. Hartlepool FC\u2019s mascot, H\u2019Angus the Monkey, was famously elected mayor in 2002. The seat, Labour since 1964, was represented by Peter Mandelson for 12 years.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Iain Wright"
"189","312","Hexham","Hexham","Atypically for Northumberland, there are relatively high numbers of professionals and well-off middle classes in this large constituency. Hexham is surrounded by miles of open countryside with villages dotted through, especially north toward the Cheviot Hills and Kielder, Britain\u2019s largest man-made lake. To the south of the seat is Hadrian\u2019s Wall and the North Pennines, with settlements at Haltwhistle, Prudhoe \u2013 a former mining town \u2013 and the affluent commuter hub of Ponteland, near Newcastle. Conservatives have held the seat since 1924, despite a significant coalmining Labour vote, but in 1997 they won by only 222 votes.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Peter Atkinson"
"190","320","Houghton & Sunderland South","Houghton_and_Sunderland_South","At the extreme south of Tyne and Wear, this coalfields constituency centres on the town of Houghton-le-Spring. Boundary changes remove Washington from the north and add the Doxton area from the southwestern fringe of Sunderland, where South Rainton Bridge business park is a new centre of employment \u2013 N-Power moved in from Newcastle. In the north is the Penshaw Monument, Sunderland&apos;s most prominent landmark. Modelled on the Theseum at Athens, it was built in 1844 by public subscription. A white, working-class area, predecessor seats were strongly Labour-voting.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Fraser Kemp"
"191","337","Jarrow","Jarrow","For ever associated with the march of 1936, the town of Jarrow sits to the south of the river Tyne, just east of Newcastle. It still suffers severe deprivation caused by the decline of traditional industries, most notably shipbuilding. To its west is Hebburn while to the south and east it extends to the villages of Boldon and the more affluent Cleadon. Following boundary changes, it no longer reaches the coast. This has long been a safe Labour seat.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen Hepburn"
"192","394","Middlesbrough","Middlesbrough","At the heart of Teesside, Middlesbrough was dubbed the Hercules of Britain for its industry and engineering. It has yet to recover from their decline, with Corus closures in 2009 compounding the misery. Unemployment and deprivation are severe. Middlehaven, the old dockland, is earmarked for \u00a3500 million regeneration and a merger with neighbouring Stockton is planned for the next 20 years. Ray Mallon, its directly-elected independent mayor, was dubbed Robocop when he ran Middlesbrough CID until a corruption scandal. Predominantly working-class and white, Middlesbrough has returned a Labour MP by more than 50 per cent in every election since 1935.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stuart Bell"
"193","395","Middlesbrough South & Cleveland East","Middlesbrough_South_and_East_Cleveland","Only the very southern fringes of Middlesbrough are included in this seat, which stretches out to the coast. Straddling borough boundaries, it encompasses the pretty market town of Guisborough in the centre and Saltburn-by-the-Sea, Brotton and Loftus at the east. Prosperity varies from pockets of severe deprivation in Stainton to affluent areas near Roseberry Topping, the oddly-shaped hill. On the whole it is better off and less staunchly Labour than the main town constituency, having changed political hands several times.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries, Ashok Kumar, dide in March."
"194","414","Newcastle upon Tyne Central","Newcastle-upon-Tyne_Central","Boundaries have been slightly redrawn to include a greater stretch of riverside at the south and the historic city centre around Grainger town. It loses some areas, predominantly from the east. There are high numbers of professionals but also areas of severe deprivation. The seat is ethnically diverse by northeastern standards and includes Chinatown. St James\u2019 Park, home of Newcastle United FC, looks down on the city from its elevated location. The seat is traditionally Labour but Lib Dems have made advances in recent years.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jim Cousins"
"195","415","Newcastle upon Tyne East","Newcastle-upon-Tyne_East","Socio-economically, the constituency has contrasting halves. Two universities dominate the north, providing many students and young professionals in Jesmond and Heaton. The south has large council estates and severely deprived areas, including Byker Wall estate, notorious as home of the child burglar \u201cRatboy\u201d in the 1990s but famous as the setting for the children\u2019s TV show Byker Grove, which launched the careers of Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. The seat has lost Wallsend and almost reaches the city centre to include the distinctive Millennium Bridge. The seat is traditionally Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nick Brown"
"196","416","Newcastle upon Tyne North","Newcastle-upon-Tyne_North","This seat covers the northwestern fringes of Newcastle, including Westerhope and the eastern part of the middle-class commuter suburb Gosforth, which the new boundary cuts in half down the High Street. The seat extends into the countryside, with towns and villages such as Throckley and Newburn in the south and Dinnington in the north. Newcastle International Airport lies at the western edge. Residents are comfortably well-off but although the area is increasingly middle-class, it is shaped politically by the legacy of old Tyneside industries and has a long Labour history.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Doug Henderson"
"197","466","Redcar","Redcar","From Redcar and Marske-by-the-Sea, the constituency reaches inland to the fringes of Middlesbrough. Bordered by the Tees to the north, an expanse of land by the river is dominated by heavy industrial works sites, much of it vacant after extensive redundancies from Corus steel in 2009. This devastated the economy and compounded deprivation that was already severe in pockets of the town and the area around South Bank and Skippers Lane industrial estate. The seat has been Labour since its inception in 1974.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Vera Baird"
"198","499","Sedgefield","Sedgefield","This large seat almost encircles Darlington at the south and stretches north-east nearly to the coast. The many former colliery villages include Trimdon, the constituency home of Tony Blair for 1983-2007. Many remain severely deprived since the Eighties pit closures. So are many of the densely-populated council estates of Newton Aycliffe, which in 1947 was the North\u2019s first new town. Sedgfield itself has large housing developments around the historic village. President Bush and Tony Blair shared a lunch of fish, chips and mushy peas at its Dun Cow pub in 2003. This has been a safe Labour seat since its inception.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Phil Wilson"
"199","522","South Shields","South_Shields","On the south bank of the Tyne, this is a working-class and overwhelmingly white constituency . A big manufacturing presence includes Barbour\u2019s Simonside plant, which produces the famous wax jackets. Rekendyke and Horsley Hill are especially deprived. The boundary now includes a strip of coastline south of the town, to the village of Whitburn. For a passionate argument about football, South Shields is the place: half the town supports Sunderland, the other half their sworn enemies, Newcastle United. Politically the seat has been Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Miliband"
"200","535","Stockton North","Stockton_North","The northeastern half of Stockton-on-Tees encompasses not only the commercial and retail town centre but the sprawling expanses of industrial works along the north banks of the river, which stretch east to Billingham and have long defined the area\u2019s economy. The entire riverside is severely deprived and the town was dubbed Britain&apos;s capital of childhood obesity in 2009. The seat includes rural areas and Wolviston at the north is well-off. Regeneration is underway, with a 20-year plan to merge Stockton and Middlesbrough into one \u201cgreen\u201d city. This has been a Labour stronghold since 1945.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Frank Cook"
"201","536","Stockton South","Stockton_South","The southwestern part of Stockton includes the Bowesgate and Preston Farm industrial estates but the seat on a whole is more residential. Though Thornaby, the main town, is fairly deprived, the rest of the area is reasonably prosperous, especially by the region\u2019s standards. It includes the Fairfield suburb of Stockton and the communities of Egglescliffe, Ingleby Barwick and Yarm, which flank the Tees to the south. The Tories held the seat from its 1983 creation until Labour won in1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Dari Taylor"
"202","551","Sunderland Central","Sunderland_Central","Boundary changes unite into one constituency all but the very western fringes of Sunderland, built on the mouth of the Wear. The southern coastline is dominated by industry and warehousing but north there are beaches at Roker and Seaburn. The Stadium of Light is north of the river, just off Keir Hardie Way \u2013 a reminder of the seat\u2019s Labour tradition. The decline of old industries has left severe deprivation \u2013 most of the city centre is in the worst 5 per cent nationally \u2013 and high unemployment. The University of Sunderland provides a large student presence.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"203","582","Tynemouth","Tynemouth","The north of the Tyne is generally the better-off side, with numbers of professionals and owner-occupiers high for the region. There are still some severely deprived areas at the very south, around North Shields, and north-west, around Backworth, which is newly included after boundary changes. The coast toward the tourist resort of Whitley Bay in the north is far more affluent. The Tories held this seat for 47 years until 1997, when it formed part of Labour\u2019s seaside success story.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Alan Campbell"
"204","583","Tyneside North","North_Tyneside","This slightly redrawn seat forms a corridor between Newcastle and Tynemouth. There are some severely deprived areas in the industrial Riverside ward, which reaches from Wallsend East to North Shields and includes power plants, docks and shipyards. Longbenton and Killingworth are dense urban areas in the middle of the seat while the north is more rural and no single economic sector dominates. About a third of people live in council or social housing in this solid Labour constituency .","The current MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen Byers, who was suspended from the Labour party in March"
"205","596","Wansbeck","Wansbeck","This coastal Northumberland seat is densely populated and predominantly working-class because of its coalmining heritage. The last deep mine in the North East was at Ellington, just beyond the northern boundary; its 2005 closure had a much greater impact on Wansbeck than the Berwick-upon-Tweed seat to which it belongs. The main settlements are Bedlington, Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, the more affluent commuter town of Morpeth and Ashington, famous for its sporting greats, including the footballers Jack and Sir Bobby Charlton and the cricketer Stephen Harmison. The seat has been Labour since 1945.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Denis Murphy"
"206","603","Washington & Sunderland West","Washington_and_Sunderland_West","Washington New Town was built postwar around an old village, once home to the ancestors of George Washington. It forms the bulk of the seat, which extends east to the fringes of Sunderland, including the Nissan motor plant, one of the biggest employers. New business parks are being built amid regeneration works but deprivation \u2013 legacy of the coal industry\u2019s decline \u2013 remains, especially in the east; Washington is better off than most of Sunderland. The area has long been Labour-supporting.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Sharon Hodgson"
"207","9","Altrincham & Sale West","Altrincham_and_Sale_West","This city of Trafford seat is markedly different to most of the Greater Manchester conurbation to its northeast. The market town of Altrincham has recently undergone major development and, with Sale, has become a middle-class enclave. In the east of the seat the countryside is dotted with affluent villages. Conservative since the Second World War, in 2005 it was the last Tory seat in Manchester.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Graham Brady"
"208","21","Ashton Under Lyne","Ashton_Under_Lyne","Failsworth, in Oldham borough, borders Manchester at the western end of this urban seat, the bulk of which is in Tameside borough. The relatively affluent and predominantly white small town of Droylsden is also at the west of the seat, while the much larger, predominantly working class Ashton-under-Lyne is to the east. Ashton has large Indian and Pakistani communities and areas of deprivation ranked among the worst 5 per cent in the country. The seat has voted Labour since 1935.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Heyes"
"209","31","Barrow & Furness","Barrow_and_Furness","The working class town of Barrow-in-Furness is located at the north side of Morecambe Bay, on Cumbria\u2019s southern peninsula. BAE Systems is the major employer, providing around 5,000 jobs and continuing Barrow\u2019s shipbuilding heritage and Labour-leaning tendencies. The seat juts up towards Broughton-in-Furness, taking in South Lakeland wards, including the town of Ulverston. These have more Conservative tendencies and the seat returned Tory MPs in the 1980s before switching back to Labour in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Hutton"
"210","56","Birkenhead","Birkenhead","Facing Liverpool across the Mersey, Birkenhead constituency is bordered by docks to the north and the M53 to the west. Areas such as Tranmere, Rock Ferry and Bidston suffer from severe deprivation, with high crime and unemployment and poor-quality housing. The seat has been slightly extended in the southwest and includes the more affluent suburb of Prenton. This seat has long been a Labour stronghold.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Frank Field"
"211","67","Blackburn","Blackburn","Once the weaving capital of the world, this seat has fought hard to combat the decline of its industries. Its plight is typified by rows of dilapidated terraced houses. About one quarter of the population is of Indian or Pakistani origin, however, the town has avoided the extreme racial tension seen in neighbouring areas. The M65 extension, intended to boost the sluggish local economy, has instead seen people commuting to work elsewhere. Some suburban and rural wards at the fringes of the seat are more prosperous. The seat has a strong Labour history.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jack Straw"
"212","68","Blackley & Broughton","Blackley_and_Broughton","The northernmost part of Manchester, formerly Blackley constituency, is joined by Broughton and Kersal, two deprived Salford wards divided from the rest of their borough by the River Irwell. Charlestown, on the edge of Manchester, is the city\u2019s least diverse ward while the population of Cheetham, nearer the centre, comprises 48.7 per cent ethnic minorites. It is also home to the prison formerly known as Strangeways. Harpurhey has many large estates and is particularly deprived. The seat has returned Labour MPs in recent decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Graham Stringer"
"213","69","Blackpool North & Cleveleys","Blackpool_North_and_Cleveleys","The Blackpool North seat used to extend up the coast to Fleetwood; after boundary changes its northern extremity reaches only Cleveleys, while it has gained the Park ward of Blackpool to the south. Park and Claremont wards are severely deprived and the seat is fairly poor with high unemployment \u2014 especially during the off-season. Blackpool had the lowest male life expectancy of all local authorities in England and Wales in 2007. The seat was Tory from the Second World War until Labour\u2019s landslide of 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Joan Humble"
"214","70","Blackpool South","Blackpool_South","The heart of Blackpool\u2019s traditional resort \u2014 with the iconic Pleasure Beach and Tower \u2014 is included in this seat, which has been cut in size in the northeast. The northwestern boundary is marked by the North Pier. The Blackpool Illuminations every autumn draw in visitors but the town has struggled to adapt to changing markets. It had a casino-based regeneration bid rejected and much of the town is severely deprived, with Bloomfield ward the fifth worst in the UK. Labour took this seat from the Tories in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Graham Marsden"
"215","76","Bolton North East","Bolton_North_East","The northern constituency of this formerly industrial town includes most of central Bolton, with its shopping centres and old town hall \u2014 as featured by Peter Kay, its most famous export, in Live at the Bolton Albert Halls. The town has been the scene of significant regeneration in recent years. Beyond the centre are residential areas and the seat also includes some rural land at its northern extremities. It has generally returned an MP of the government of the day, with the exception of 1979-83.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Crausby"
"216","77","Bolton South East","Bolton_South_East","The population of this seat is concentrated in south Bolton and Farnworth, which are sandwiched between the M61 and the railway that transports commuters the 11 miles down to Manchester. Beyond this central avenue are woodland and open spaces with smaller communities. The traditionally industrial economy has diversified into service and public sectors but business parks remain and the area is less affluent, and has more council housing, than elsewhere in Bolton. About 12 per cent of residents are ethnic minorities. The seat has been Labour since its creation in 1983.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Brian Iddon"
"217","78","Bolton West","Bolton_West","This seat sits predominantly to the west of Bolton and takes in only a slither of the town, instead containing large rural areas and the town of Atherton, in the Wigan ward. The town of Horwich, the new home of Bolton Wanderers FC, lies five miles northwest of Bolton amid the West Pennine Moors. Westhoughton, whose residents tend to be more affluent than in Bolton, is another popular small town in this seat. The seat was Tory until 1997 when it turned Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ruth Kelly"
"218","79","Bootle","Bootle","Although it has retained the same name, the Bootle seat, just north of Liverpool, has been substantially extended to the north and encompasses the southern half of Crosby, which used to have its own seat. This deprived area is typified by high unemployment, low income, social problems and poor health. It is overwhelmingly white working class and regarded as the safest Labour seat in the country.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Joe Benton"
"219","109","Burnley","Burnley","Violent clashes stoked by racial tensions in the summer of 2001 drew national attention to underlying problems in the East Lancashire town. The community has struggled with the decline of its textile and heavy industries and suffers from the chronic urban problems of ill health, high unemployment and a low-skilled workforce. Rows of derelict terraced houses typify the town, although the seat includes a rural area to the south. Burnley&apos;s population is about 7 per cent ethnic minority. The BNP has had success here but the seat has long returned Labour MPs.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Kitty Ussher"
"220","111","Bury North","Bury_North","The constituency spans from Bury in the south to the market town of Ramsbottom, with its historic steam railway, in the north. Bury was once dominated by the textile industry but, on the northern bounds of Greater Manchester, it is now part of the middle-class commuter belt. It is famous for its black pudding. The seat was taken from the Tories by Labour in 1997 but its MP until 2010, David Chaytor, had the Labour whip but has been forced to stand down after being charged with false accounting of his expenses.","The current MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Chaytor, who was suspended from the Labour party in February"
"221","112","Bury South","Bury_South","Despite the name, this seat includes none of the official Bury wards. Instead, it encompasses Radcliffe, with its roots in coal and cotton, and settlements either side of the M60, which slices through the south of the constituency. Whitefield, north of the motorway, and Prestwich, to the south, are both sought-after commuter residential areas in this seat sandwiched between Manchester to the southeast and Bolton to the northwest. It switched to Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ivan Lewis"
"222","130","Carlisle","Carlisle","The remains of Hadrian&apos;s Wall run through Carlisle, the capital of Cumbria and the northernmost city in England. It is overwhelmingly working class, with about one fifth living in council housing. The local economy is focused on distribution, retailing and health and social work and major employers include McVitie\u2019s, Pirelli and the local company Eddie Stobart. The area suffered during the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak and serious flooding in 2005. This seat has long been represented by Labour, although recent boundary changes have included some Tory areas beyond the city.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Eric Martlew"
"223","138","Cheadle","Cheadle","This atypical Greater Manchester seat is affluent and has the highest proportion of lower managerial and professional workers in the North. The market town of Cheadle sits by the M60, which runs along the top of the constituency heading northeast into neighbouring Stockport. The seat also takes in the leafy commuter towns of Cheadle Hulme and Bramhall. It has been marginal between the Lib Dems and Tories.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mark Hunter, who won the 2005 by-election following the death of Patsy Calton"
"224","143","Chester, City of","City_of_Chester","With Roman heritage, historic city walls and a picturesque location on the River Dee, Chester is a popular tourist destination, as well as a sought-after location for affluent professionals. The largest private-sector employer is Bank of America. There are small areas of deprivation such as in Blacon. The boundaries take in outlying areas to the north, south and east, while the western boundary is the border with Wales. Having been Conservative since the First World War, it was a surprise win for Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Christine Russell"
"225","149","Chorley","Chorley","The large market town of Chorley lies at the centre of this constituency in the south of Lancashire. The seat has been cut back, losing two of its most rural wards from the west. It is an area experiencing strong economic growth and becoming increasingly affluent. With three motorways passing through the seat and strong rail links nearby, the rural areas are sought-after commuter territory. The land to the east is part of the West Pennine Moors. This has tended to be a bellwether seat.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Lindsay Hoyle"
"226","159","Congleton","Congleton","The market town of Congleton, once famed for silk manufacture, lies at the east of this diamond-shaped seat. The other main towns are Alsager, in the south, Middlewich, in the west, and Sandbach, in between the two. The seat is very well off, with residents of its towns and villages enjoying the Cheshire countryside and excellent transport links on the M6. There are high numbers of professionals and manufacturing, although in decline, remains significant. It has been safely Conservative since its inception in 1983.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Ann Winterton"
"227","160","Copeland","Copeland","The coastline of this West Cumbria seat includes the working-class town of Whitehaven and the Sellafield nuclear power station, which has long defined the area economically. Tourism also plays a key economic role. The seat reaches into the centre of the Lake District National Park and includes England's deepest lake, Wastwater, and its highest mountain, Scafell Pike. Sheep farming is also notable, although it employs only about 3 per cent of the population. About a quarter of the population live in council housing and the seat has been Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jamie Reed"
"228","169","Crewe & Nantwich","Crewe_and_Nantwich","This constituency in southern Cheshire has two distinct parts: the industrial, Labour-leaning railway town of Crewe with its tradition of car manufacture, and the more affluent, Conservative-voting Nantwich, famed for its cheese making, and the surrounding villages. Regeneration and housing renewal are gradually transforming Crewe. Labour held the seat from 1945 until the death of the Labour MP Gwyneth Dunwoody in 2008, when the Conservatives dramatically defeated her daughter, Tamsin, in a by-election.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Edward Timpson"
"229","180","Denton & Reddish","Denton_and_Reddish","Reddish, in Stockport borough, sits at the southwest of this constituency, which extends through Tameside borough to Audenshaw and Dukinfield, by the River Tame, in the north. Denton, at the heart of this largely urban seat, is about six miles east of Manchester. The M60 and M67 motorways pass through the middle of the constituency and it has benefited as part of the M60 investment corridor. The seat used to be industrial and retains above average manual and skilled manual labourers. There is strong support for Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew Gwynne"
"230","227","Eddisbury","Eddisbury","This seat comprises a large expanse of rural Cheshire, between Chester and Crewe, and one significant town, Winsford, at the northeastern corner. A notable agricultural sector, predominantly dairy farming, employs about 5 per cent of the population. Within easy reach of Manchester and Liverpool to the north, the rural area is also home to many affluent, Conservative-voting professionals. Winsford, built around the salt mining industry, is less affluent and tends to be Labour-leaning, meaning that Conservative margins of victory here have been slim.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen O'Brien"
"231","234","Ellesmere Port & Neston","Ellesmere_Port_and_Neston","The seat spans the base of the Wirral peninsula, with Ellesmere Port on the Mersey and Neston on the Dee. Ellesmere Port is heavily industrialised and famous for the Vauxhall factory, which remains the largest employer. To the east is Stanlow refinery and there are patches of severe deprivation along the Mersey waterfront. Other parts are more affluent: Neston was originally a market town, while the flat expanse of land in between is mostly rural with villages that have good transport links to Liverpool. The seat switched from Conservative to Labour in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew Miller"
"232","256","Fylde","Fylde","This seat on the north bank of the River Ribble is one of the most affluent areas in Lancashire. The rural areas are popular with commuters, with the M55 motorway bisecting the seat and connecting to the M6. The BAE Systems base at Warton dominates the economy. St Anne&apos;s remains a popular seaside town and, like many coastal areas, has high numbers of retired people, as does neighbouring Lytham. The other main town is Kirkham. Blackpool airport is within the seat, which has returned Tory MPs since 1945.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Michael Jack"
"233","258","Garston & Halewood","Garston_and_Halewood","The majority of the old Liverpool Garston constituency remains in this seat, but the new name reflects the addition of the suburb of Halewood, formerly in Knowsley South. The area in the south of the seat, around John Lennon airport and Garston Docks, is extremely deprived, as is the Belle Vale district in the north. The suburb of Woolton, however, is one of the most affluent in Liverpool and salaries compare favourably with the national average. The predecessor seats were both Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Maria Eagle"
"234","285","Halton","Halton","Although technically part of Chester, this constituency lies on either side of the Mersey, where it narrows at the Runcorn Gap. The post-war new town of Runcorn lies to the south and long-established Widnes to the north. Both have large areas of severe deprivation. Overwhelmingly white, working class and traditionally reliant on the chemical industry, this seat has been Labour since its inception in 1983.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Derek Twigg"
"235","301","Hazel Grove","Hazel_Grove","Just east of Stockport, this seat stretches to the foot of the Pennines. Hazel Grove, in the south of the seat, was traditionally focused on silk mills and coal mining but is now an affluent commuter hub. Marple, which lies in a picturesque setting in the Goyt Valley along the Peak Forest Canal, and Romiley, are also sought-after locations in this middle-class seat. The Lib Dems ousted the Tories in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew Stunell"
"236","313","Heywood & Middleton","Heywood_and_Middleton","This seat lies between Bury to the west and Oldham to the south. It takes in a southwestern part of Rochdale town but, unlike the neighbouring seat, it is 96 per cent white. It is solidly working class and, although it has a significant hotel and catering sector, it suffered from the decline of the textiles industry. It has been hit by the recession, with Woolworths one of the big names closing. This has long been a safe Labour seat.","The current Labour\/Co-op MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jim Dobbin"
"237","327","Hyndburn","Hyndburn","Bisected by the M65, this seat lies toward the east of Lancashire, between Blackburn and Burnley. The main settlements of Oswaldtwistle, Great Harwood and Accrington are situated near the motorway, while Haslingden, in the south, is on the A56. There is a strong manufacturing sector but the economy is generally sluggish and deprivation and unemployment are relatively high. The Tories narrowly held this seat from its creation in 1983 until 1992, when Labour gained it.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Greg Pope"
"238","346","Knowsley","Knowsley","This new seat to the east of Liverpool unites the bulk of Knowsley borough, formerly divided between two seats, excluding only the Halewood and Whiston areas in the south. The population is concentrated in two very deprived areas: Huyton in the south and Kirkby in the north. The M57 runs the length of the seat, passing through some more affluent areas near Knowsley Park in the centre, while the M62 cuts through the southwestern corner near the prosperous Roby. Both the predecessor seats here were Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Eddie O'Hara"
"239","349","Lancashire West","West_Lancashire","At the southwestern tip of Lancashire, this is a seat of contrasts. Small towns and villages are popular with commuters to Manchester and Liverpool, while the market town of Ormskirk thrives with Edge Hill University. Skelmersdale, however, built in the 1960s as a new town for manufacturing workers from Liverpool, suffers from deprivation from the decline of industries and outdated town planning. Regeneration is under way and Matalan has its headquarters there. With the exception of a Tory interlude from 1983 to 1992, this has generally been a Labour seat.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Rosie Cooper"
"240","350","Lancaster & Fleetwood","Lancaster_and_Fleetwood","The M6 motorway and West Coast Main Line rail form the spine of this new seat, passing through Lancaster, with its historic castle and two universities, at the northern boundary. To the east lies rural land, while, to the west, the seat extends to Fleetwood, divided from the rest of the seat by the River Wyre. Fleetwood has pockets of deprivation in an otherwise prosperous seat. Traditional fishing industries have declined but there are still fish processing businesses. Fleetwood was previously in a Labour seat, while Lancaster was Tory.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ben Wallace"
"241","361","Leigh","Leigh","Substantially redrawn, the seat has effectively shifted east, losing Hindley to Wigan and gaining Tyldesley and the rural area around Astley Green. The bird reserve lake of Pennington Flash was formed from mining subsidence and lies just outside the town of Leigh, which, like most settlements in the seat, was historically dependent on cotton and coal industries. It has been Labour since 1922, usually with at least 50 per cent of the vote.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andy Burnham"
"242","370","Liverpool Riverside","Liverpool_Riverside","Liverpool city centre, with its cathedrals, museums and the iconic Albert Dock, has undergone major regeneration in recent years and its designation as European Capital of Culture 2008 confirmed its new image. Liverpool borough, however, remains the most deprived in England and this seat, extending either side of the centre along the banks of the Mersey, generally remains extremely poor, especially around the dilapidated terraced houses of Princes Park ward, which has an ethnic minority population of almost 40 per cent. The seat has long been a Labour stronghold.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Louise Ellman"
"243","371","Liverpool Walton","Liverpool_Walton","This seat contains some of the most deprived wards in England, notably the terraced streets of Everton around the football club. Liverpool FC&apos;s Anfield base is also in this seat. At the north of the city, the seat is primarily residential. It is overwhelmingly white and working class with high unemployment \u2014 a legacy of the decline of the docks. It has been Labour since 1964.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Peter Kilfoyle"
"244","372","Liverpool Wavertree","Liverpool_Wavertree","The boundaries have been changed but the seat remains, essentially, a residential area to the east of the city centre. There is a geographical divide in terms of affluence, with semi-detached houses lining leafy streets in the middle-class suburbs of Church and Childwall to the south, and dilapidated terraced and council houses in Kensington and Fairfield to the north. Although an old seat of the same name was strongly Conservative until it was abolished in 1983, this seat was won by Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jane Kennedy"
"245","373","Liverpool West Derby","Liverpool_West_Derby","West Derby, in the northeast of Liverpool, is one of the more affluent areas of the city and lies at the centre of this seat, with middle classes also concentrated around Croxteth Hall and Country Park in the northeast of the seat. This band of relative prosperity is flanked by areas of severe deprivation in the estates of Norris Green in the northwest and the Dovecot and Yew Tree areas to the southeast. Bob Wareing took this seat for Labour in 1983 but was deselected in 2007 and sat as an independent thereafter.","The current MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries, Robert Wareing, who defected from Labour after being deselected, has announced he is standing down."
"246","382","Macclesfield","Macclesfield","Macclesfield, with its cobbled streets and former textile mills, lies at the centre of the seat, surrounded by Cheshire countryside, the eastern half of which lies within the Peak District National Park. Poynton, on the outskirts of Stockport, and Bollington are the other main settlements. This well-off seat is home to well-educated and well-paid professionals, many of whom commute north to Manchester. The seat has been Conservative since 1918.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nicholas Winterton"
"247","385","Makerfield","Makerfield","This Greater Manchester constituency has lost a couple of wards to Wigan but gained Hindley and Hindley Green from neighbouring Leigh. With them comes Bickershaw Colliery, which in 1992 became the last pit to close in the borough. Ashton-in-Makerfield is the third-largest town in Wigan and, along with the other former mining communities in this seat, is white, working class and solidly Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ian McCartney"
"248","387","Manchester Central","Manchester_Central","Manchester city centre was substantially rebuilt after the devastation of the 1996 IRA bombing and is the heart of this seat and home to the banking and service sectors. Its Northern Quarter, once a wasteland, has been redeveloped into a vibrant cultural area, while the distinctive Urbis building is being converted to a National Football Museum. The varied constituency also includes the deprived estates of Moss Side, the City of Manchester Stadium and old warehouses along the Manchester Ship Canal. The seat has been Labour since its creation in 1974.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tony Lloyd"
"249","388","Manchester Gorton","Manchester_Gorton","Gorton, a traditionally white suburb now undergoing regeneration, lies in the east of this Manchester seat, just south of the city centre. The constituency also encompasses Manchester&apos;s famous Curry Mile, the residential suburb of Levenshulme, an antiques and market hub, and Fallowfield, with its student halls of residence and a youthful demographic. The westernmost ward, Whalley Range, has a diverse community and boasts parks and woodland. The seat has been Labour for most of the past century.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Gerald Kaufman"
"250","389","Manchester Withington","Manchester_Withington","The popular residential areas comprising this Manchester constituency are home to a very high proportion of yuppies and students \u2014 around 35 per cent of the population of Withington ward are aged 20-24. The seat, which lies about three miles south of the city centre, is relatively affluent and sought-after because of large old houses, mostly now split up for rental. It has a varied political history, having switched from Tories to Labour under Margaret Thatcher before a surprise win for the Lib Dems in 2005.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Leech"
"251","404","Morecambe & Lunesdale","Morecambe_and_Lunesdale","From the border with Cumbria, the northernmost seat in Lancashire stretches down Morecambe Bay to the River Lune. The major settlements are Carnforth, Morecambe, the old seaside resort, and Heysham, a busy port. Efforts are under way to regenerate Morecambe as a tourist destination but it has declined greatly and there are areas of severe deprivation. British Energy is a major employer, with two nuclear power ports at Heysham, while the White Lund Industrial Estate is nearby. Labour took this seat from the Tories in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Geraldine Smith"
"252","439","Oldham East & Saddleworth","Oldham_East_and_Saddleworth","This seat previously included some Rochdale wards but is now drawn from Oldham borough and stretches over to the Pennines, which rise up above the affluent villages of Saddleworth Moor. The eastern parts of Oldham town centre include large Pakistani populations concentrated in St Mary&apos;s and Alexandra wards, the scene of infamous race riots in 2001. The seat is marginal. Conservative until 1995, it was won by the Lib Dems in a dramatic by-election and has been Labour since 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Phil Woolas"
"253","440","Oldham West & Royton","Oldham_West_and_Royton","Oldham lies around seven miles northeast of Manchester and the seat includes the towns of Royton to the north and Chadderton to the west. Oldham once produced 30 per cent of the world&apos;s spun cotton but the industry declined and the town is better known for the race riots of 2001. The western part of Oldham town centre includes a large Bangladeshi population in Coldhurst ward and a Pakistani community in Werneth. The BNP polled more than 16 per cent in 2001 but the seat has been Labour since its creation in 1950.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Michael Meacher"

The main settlements \u2014 Brierfield, Nelson and Colne \u2014 are grouped around the end of the M65 at the south of the seat. Barnoldswick, in the north, is the home of the Rolls-Royce factory, a major employer. About 30 per cent of the population work in manufacturing. There are pockets of severe deprivation and much of the urban terraced housing stock is unfit to live in, although rural areas toward the Ribble Valley are more affluent. Labour took this seat from the Tories in 1992.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Gordon Prentice"
"255","449","Penrith & The Border","Penrith_and_the_Border","This huge Cumbrian seat stretches from the edge of the Yorkshire Dales to the border with Scotland, skirting around Carlisle. In the west lies Wigton and some of the Lake District National Park. In the centre is the Eden Valley, with the main market town of Penrith sitting astride the M6. In the east are the Pennines, including Alston, England's highest market town. Tourism is a key industry but agriculture \u2014 especially sheep and dairy farming \u2014 dominates the economy, employing about 10 per cent of residents. It is a solidly Conservative seat.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Maclean"
"256","460","Preston","Preston","Preston is at the heart of Lancashire and this seat contains all but its northern residential suburbs. The University of Central Lancashire is based here with 32,000 students and 3,000 staff skewing the seat&apos;s demographic and contributing to a science sector of the economy. The city has significant areas of deprivation, with St Matthew&apos;s and Deepdale wards among the worst 10 per cent nationwide. Booths supermarkets has its headquarters in Ribbleton, in the northeast of the seat. It has been Labour since its creation in 1983.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mark Hendrick"
"257","471","Ribble Valley","Ribble_Valley","One of the most affluent areas in Lancashire, the Ribble Valley is a predominantly rural seat centred around the large market town of Clitheroe. British Aerospace has a base at Samlesbury and traditional dairy farms have diversified to cater for tourism in the attractive Forest of Bowland. The seat has traditionally been Tory but the Lib Dems held it for one year in 1991 after winning a by-election triggered by the resignation of the former Home Secretary David Waddington.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nigel Evans"
"258","474","Rochdale","Rochdale","At the north of Greater Manchester, this seat extends from Rochdale across the South Pennine Moors. It has not yet recovered from the decline of the textile industry. There are high levels of unskilled manual workers and those who have never worked. The large ethnic minority population includes about 15 per cent Pakistanis and community cohesion is an important issue. As the home of the co-operative movement, it is an atypical working class seat with strong Liberal tendencies and is marginal, most recently being won by the Lib Dems from Labour in 2005.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Paul Rowen"
"259","480","Rossendale & Darwen","Rossendale_and_Darwen","At the southeastern corner of Lancashire and just north of the Bolton-Rochdale conurbation, this seat straddles borough boundaries. Darwen, with its imposing tower, lies near Blackburn in the west, and is divided by Pennine moors from Rossendale in the east, where Rawtenstall is the main settlement. There is a strong manufacturing presence. Scout Moor is home to 26 wind turbines, the largest onshore site in England. There are pockets of deprivation in the urban centres, having suffered major redundancies from Airtours. Labour won this seat from the Tories in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Janet Anderson"
"260","492","St Helens North","St_Helens_North","From the northern half of St Helens, the seat fans out through rural land, with Rainford at the affluent western end, Billinge in the centre and Haydock and Newton-le-Willows in the east. The coal and glass industries have declined from their heyday, leaving areas of deprivation, but manufacturing remains above average and the public service sector is also strongly represented. The seat&apos;s core is white, working class and Labour-voting.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Watts"
"261","493","St Helens South & Whiston","St_Helens_South_and_Whiston","St Helens town centre lies at the north of this seat, which also includes Prescot at the west. St Helens has a strong industrial heritage, notably in glass making, and its decline has left deprivation and high unemployment. Regeneration efforts include a planned transformation of the derelict United Glass site into a new stadium for the Saints Rugby League FC. The M62 runs through the south, linking to Liverpool and Manchester on either side. The old St Helens South seat, which was held by Labour, has been substantially increased in size with the addition of Whiston.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Shaun Woodward"
"262","495","Salford & Eccles","Salford_and_Eccles","This Greater Manchester seat combines most of the old Salford seat with the northern part of Eccles, once known for the number of Coronation Street stars among its residents. The seat is bordered by the River Irwell to the east and Manchester Ship Canal to the south. The Salford Quays have undergone regeneration in recent years and several BBC departments are due to move here in 2011. Much of the rest of the seat remains deprived and about one in four residents say that they have a limiting, long-term illness. The seat has been Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Hazel Blears"
"263","500","Sefton Central","Sefton_Central","From Formby at the north, this seat stretches down the coast towards Liverpool, encompassing the northern half of Crosby town and extending inland to Maghull. It is generally well off, with commuters enjoying good transport links to the nearby cities, although the area immediately between the M57 and M58 is more deprived. The Crosby and Knowsley North and Sefton East constituencies from which this new seat was formed were both Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Claire Curtis-Thomas"
"264","521","South Ribble","South_Ribble","South Ribble, which includes about two thirds of the borough of the same name, also encompasses wards from Chorley and West Lancashire. The seat&apos;s northern boundary follows the River Ribble out to the coast, while the main settlements are concentrated to the east of the seat near the M6, which runs past longitudinally. These include Penwortham, a suburb of Preston, Leyland, home to the truck manufacturers, and Eccleston. It is comfortably affluent and was held by the Tories until Labour&apos;s landslide of 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Borrow"
"265","526","Southport","Southport","Encompassing a stretch of coastline roughly halfway between the Ribble and Mersey estuaries, Southport seat contains the eponymous town,as well as Birkdale and Ainsdale to the south. Southport is a relatively upmarket seaside resort with a large number of professionals commuting to nearby cities but it does have a few pockets of deprivation along the seafront. It is also home to a high number of retired people. It has been marginal between Conservatives and Lib Dems since the 1980s.","The current Lib Dem MP for this seat is John Pugh"
"266","531","Stalybridge & Hyde","Stalybridge_and_Hyde","At the eastern extremity of Greater Manchester, this seat extends through a vast stretch of moorland at the foot of the Pennines. The main settlements form an urban band up the west side of the seat. Hyde, by the M67 in the south, includes Werneth ward, with more than half of the borough\u2019s total Bangladeshi population. Stalybridge, in the centre, and Mossley, to the north, are more predominantly white. The seat was traditionally working class due to old mill industries and, in recent years, Labour has polled around 50 per cent.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is James Purnell"
"267","534","Stockport","Stockport","Situated to the southeast of Manchester, Stockport sits astride the M60. The sandstone market town was traditionally industrial, with a specialist millinery heritage, but is now a busy urban centre. It has fairly average socio-economic class distribution but the highest percentage of economically active residents in Greater Manchester, further bolstered by recent regeneration work. It switched from Tory to Labour in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ann Coffey"
"268","545","Stretford & Urmston","Stretford_and_Urmston","This mostly residential area of Trafford is separated from Salford to the north by the Manchester Ship Canal. The M60 cuts through the seat, dividing the towns of Urmston and Stretford. The Old Trafford area reaches almost to central Manchester, bordering on Moss Side and sharing its deprived characteristics. It is home to the cricket ground, Manchester United FC, the Trafford shopping centre and a large business park. The seat was won by Labour on its creation in 1997, but one of its predecessor seats had been Conservative.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Beverley Hughes"
"269","563","Tatton","Tatton","Centred on the market town of Knutsford, the Tatton constituency covers an extremely affluent area of north Cheshire, popular with professionals who commute north to Manchester. The biggest town is Wilmslow by Manchester airport at the northern boundary. The village of Alderley Edge is known for astronomically high house prices. AstraZeneca is a key employer. Some rural areas to the south are less well off. The seat has been solidly Conservative with the notable exception of independent anti-sleaze MP Martin Bell\u2019s defeat of Neil Hamilton in 1997.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is George Osborne"
"270","592","Wallasey","Wallasey","On the western bank at the head of the Mersey estuary, this seat looks across to Bootle and the north end Liverpool and is well connected to them through road and rail tunnels. A mixed seat, there is severe deprivation in Seacombe, by the docks, and Moreton, to the west, while regeneration is under way in the seaside town of New Brighton. There are, however, some better-off areas in Wallasey and it only switched to Labour in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Angela Eagle"
"271","599","Warrington North","Warrington_North","Containing the densely packed inner-urban residential areas of Warrington \u2013 although not the actual town centre \u2013 this corner of the former industrial town, north of the Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal, has traditionally been working class. Areas of deprivation remain in the centre but the east is increasingly affluent, with professionals enjoying semi-rural Cheshire and good transport links, with the M6 and M62 meeting in the middle of this seat. Business parks have a strategic location for distribution. This has been a Labour stronghold for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Helen Jones"
"272","600","Warrington South","Warrington_South","Warrington\u2019s retail and commercial town centre lies at the north of the seat, with some deprived urban areas around it. Much industry was traditionally based here, by the Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal, which bisects the seat. However, the centre is undergoing regeneration and the surrounding areas have long been more affluent. Penketh in the west, Stockton Heath and Appleton Thorn in the south and Lymm in the east are home to high numbers of professionals. The seat was held by the Conservatives before switching to Labour in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Helen Southworth"
"273","607","Weaver Vale","Weaver_Vale","Reaching from the banks of the Mersey down into Cheshire countryside, Weaver Vale is a varied seat. The main town of Northwich lies at the east and, along with Frodsham and Norton in the north, has areas of severe deprivation. About 25 per cent of residents in these white, working class towns live in council housing. Regeneration projects are, however, slowly improving the urban areas, while smaller towns in the rural areas are more affluent and home to large numbers of professionals commuting to Liverpool. The seat was won by Labour on its creation in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mike Hall"
"274","616","Westmorland & Lonsdale","Westmorland_and_Lonsdale","From Morecambe Bay this seat reaches up through some of the Lake District\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, including Coniston, Grasmere and Ambleside, at the head of Lake Windermere. Beyond the park lie Kendal and smaller towns such as Milnthorpe. To the east the seat stretches to the Yorkshire Dales National Park. About 5 per cent of the population is engaged in agriculture. The most middle class of the Cumbria seats, the area had returned Tory MPs for decades but the Lib Dems took the seat in 2005.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tim Farron"
"275","618","Wigan","Wigan","Wigan lies at the western end of Greater Manchester, around halfway between the cities of Liverpool and Manchester. Despite an industrial reputation, the town has a pretty centre and the constituency, which extends to its north, has countryside and lakes, with former mining communities like Standish in between. After boundary changes the seat includes Ince-in-Makerfield. It has been solidly Labour since 1918.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Neil Turner"
"276","624","Wirral South","Wirral_South","Spanning the width of the Wirral peninsula, the seat\u2019s main settlements lie at either side and are home to relatively affluent middle classes, although the docks and industry lining the east coast support an above-average manufacturing sector. Bebington looks across the Mersey to the south side of Liverpool, the M53 runs through the centre of the seat, while Heswall and Gayton - popular with retired people - are at the west, on the Dee estuary. The seat was held by the Tories from its creation in 1982 until Labour took it with a dramatic win in a 1997 by-election.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ben Chapman"
"277","625","Wirral West","Wirral_West","The affluent northwestern corner of the Wirral peninsula is home to many middle-class professionals, often working in the public sector, health and education, and commuting to Liverpool. The coastal towns of Hoylake and West Kirby are popular with retired people. The seat, which was Conservative until 1997, reaches down to the northern part of Heswall and is bounded to the east by the M53. Its boundary has been cut back with the loss of Prenton.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen Hesford"
"278","636","Workington","Workington","This northwestern Cumbrian seat divides roughly into three parts. At the north is the Solway Firth, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty on the border with Scotland. A fork south along the coast leads to Maryport and Workington, which have struggled since the decline of the coal, iron and steel industries. They are the working class, with more than a fifth living in social housing. The seat\u2019s other fork, to the southeast, runs down to Bassenthwaite Lake, in the Lake District National Park. This seat has been Labour since 1931.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tony Cunningham"
"279","637","Worsley & Eccles South","Worsley_and_Eccles_South","This city of Salford seat is loosely based on the old Worsley seat but with the loss of the Wigan wards and the gain of a sizeable chunk from the southwest of the old Eccles seat. It contains the deprived, formerly industrial areas of south Eccles, Little Hulton and other built-up areas that lie between the M62 and the shipping canal. To the west of the motorway is Worsley, an historic town astride the Bridgewater Canal that is home to some affluent residents, including the footballer Ryan Giggs. The predecessor seats here were both Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Barbara Keeley"
"280","643","Wyre & Preston North","Wyre_and_Preston_North","The M6 runs up the spine of this new Lancashire seat with Fulwood, a suburb of Preston with sought-after residential streets of terraced and detached houses, just inside the seat\u2019s southern boundary. Garstang in the north is similarly well connected and the good road links make the rural area popular with affluent commuters. The seat extends northwest across the River Wyre to Thornton and Poulton-le-Fylde, just inland from Blackpool. This seat has tended to vote Tory in the past.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"281","645","Wythenshawe & Sale East","Wythenshawe_and_Sale_East","The M60 runs along the north of this constituency, which lies to the southwest of Manchester. Five wards of the seat are Wythenshawe, created in the 1920s as a \u201cgarden city\u201d but better known as one of Europe\u2019s largest council house estates, with its social problems caricatured in the television drama Shameless. The main employers are industrial estates such as Roundthorn and Sharston. The other three wards, Sale East, are taken from Trafford borough. They are dramatically different and have a population of more affluent commuters. Labour has represented here for decades.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Paul Goggins"
"282","13","Antrim East","East_Antrim","This is the fourth most Protestant constituency, with the Catholic population concentrated at its southern and northern extremities. A coastal sliver, it begins as commuter belt for Belfast, runs through dormitory towns such as Carrickfergus, with its famous castle, and ends in the Glens of Antrim. Although there are pockets of deprivation, it is middle class and home to the University of Ulster campus at Jordanstown. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) took the seat in 2005, having lost out by a few seats to the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in 2001.","The current DUP MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Sammy Wilson"
"283","14","Antrim North","North_Antrim","Famous for its Giant\u2019s Causeway, the other giant of Ulster politics, the Rev Ian Paisley has held the seat for the 40 years until this election. It is the Ulster Scots heartland, where resistance to Irish identity is strongest. The \u201ccapital\u201d Ballymena is often referred to as the buckle in Ulster\u2019s Bible belt. Mr Paisley\u2019s conversion to the pros of power-sharing dealt the DUP a blow, prompting his former colleague Jim Allister, who now leads the hardline Protestant TUV, to take on Mr Paisley\u2019s son, Ian Jr, in this seat.","The current DUP MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Iain Paisley"
"284","15","Antrim South","South_Antrim","A deceptively suburban constituency in spite of its rural landscape, its motorways and airport makes South Antrim home to many Belfast commuters. It borders Lough Neagh, the largest freshwater lake in the British Isles. Antrim, its largest town, is blue collar. Protestants account for two-thirds of the population. The seat has been closely fought between the UUP and DUP, with supporters of other parties often voting tactically.","The current DUP MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is William McCready"
"285","45","Belfast East","Belfast_East","Dominated by the huge Samson and Goliath cranes of the Harland and Wolff shipyard, this constituency is overwhelmingly Unionist and home to some of Belfast\u2019s poorest and wealthiest citizens. Stormont, the Northern Ireland Parliament, and the police headquarters are both here. The seat has been held by Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist leader and First Minister, since 1979. In 2005 he took half of all the votes cast.","The current DUP MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Peter Robinson"
"286","46","Belfast North","Belfast_North","The patchwork of Protestant and Catholic working-class neighbourhoods made this constituency home to the highest levels of sectarian violence during the Troubles. As well as hosting what was known as \u201cThe Murder Triangle\u201d there is also the grandeur of Cave Hill, from the peak of which Scotland can be seen. The DUP took the seat from the UUP in 2001, since when the Catholic population has risen and increasing numbers of Protestants have departed.","The current DUP MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nigel Dodds"
"287","47","Belfast South","Belfast_South","Home to Belfast\u2019s most exclusive residential districts, it is also Northern Ireland\u2019s most ethnically diverse constituency. In 2009 a group of Romanian Roma families sought refuge in a Protestant church after racist attacks. Lisburn Road is known locally as \u201cKnightsbridge\u201d, with its boutiques and cafes. The Catholic population, now more than 40 per cent, is rising while Protestant numbers are falling. The seat was taken from the Ulster Unionists, who had held it for decades, in 2005 by the Social and Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) because of a split in the pro-Union vote.","The current SDLP MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Alasdair McDonnell"
"288","48","Belfast West","Belfast_West","Northern Ireland\u2019s most Catholic and poorest constituency. More than two-thirds of children were born to unmarried mothers in 2004, while 28 per cent of the population is under 16. The poorest ward is Shankill, a Protestant loyalist enclave with a towering \u201cpeace line\u201d wall separating its population from the Falls Road. Bellicose political murals are painted on both sides. The seat is dominated by Sinn Fein, which was held by the party leader Gerry Adams in 2005 with more than 70 per cent of votes cast.","The current Sinn Fein MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Gerry Adams"
"289","202","Down North","North_Down","Home to the haves and the have-yachts, as the old joke goes, this is Northern Ireland\u2019s most affluent constituency with an air of detachment often reflected by its sitting, always Unionist, MP.","The current Independent MP for this seat is Lady Sylvia Hermon, who resigned from the Ulster Unionists in March"
"290","203","Down South","South_Down","Held by Enoch Powell for 13 years, this rural constituency\u2019s capital is Downpatrick, the only town with a population in excess of 10,000. Mr Powell, on an Ulster Unionist ticket, remained despite a rising Catholic Nationalist population when he narrowly lost to Eddie McGrady of the SDLP in 1987.","The current SDLP MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Eddie McGrady"
"291","249","Fermanagh & South Tyrone","Fermanagh_and_South_Tyrone","A naturally Catholic Nationalist constituency, Unionists still have hopes of winning if a unity candidate can be agreed. The main town is Enniskillen, between the Upper and Lower Loughs Erne. The Irish border is a defining feature, explaining the strong presence of Republican irredentism. The 1981 election victory of IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands is accepted as the starting point of the peace process and the rise of Sinn Fein, which holds the seat.","The current Sinn Fein MP for this seat is Michelle Gildernew"
"292","255","Foyle","Foyle","Encompasses the city of Londonderry\/Derry (sometimes called the Maiden City to avoid having to make a choice between the two names). After West Belfast it is Northern Ireland\u2019s most Catholic constituency. Protestants have retreated from the Cityside or West Bank, under the assault of the IRA\u2019s campaign, and decamped to the Waterside across the River Foyle.","The current SDLP MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mark Durkan"
"293","347","Lagan Valley","Lagan_Valley","One of the five seats that form the suburban ring around Belfast, it contains Lisburn, which was recently granted city status despite its proximity to Belfast and not having a hotel. The constituency includes parts of strongly republican West Belfast but it is mainly middle class and Protestant. Hillsborough and its rural hinterland have not had a significant Catholic population since before the Plantation. It was held for decades by James Molyneaux, the former Ulster Unionist leader, before it was given in 1997 to Jeffrey Donaldson, who defected to the DUP and won it again for his new party in 2005. ","The current DP MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jeffery F Donaldson"
"294","376","Londonderry East","East_Londonderry","A strong Unionist seat centred on the north coast with its golf courses and rich farmland. It includes pockets of high prosperity and poor estates dominated by loyalist paramilitaries. The DUP took it from the UUP\u2019s Willie Ross, a hardliner, in 2001. ","The current DUP MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Gregory Campbell"
"295","419","Newry & Armagh","Newry_and_Armagh","The only constituency in Northern Ireland that can claim two cities. County Armagh\u2019s apple orchards deserve greater fame but lose out to the \u201cbandit country\u201d of its southern fringe, where the writ of the Provisional IRA has run for decades and contributed to a local form of ethnic cleansing. Towns such as Crossmaglen are 99 per cent Catholic. A safe Sinn Fein seat.","The current Sinn Fein MP for this seat is Conor Murphy"
"296","542","Strangford","Strangford","This overwhelmingly Unionist constituency is one of five forming a ring around Belfast, mixing the suburban with some of the finest rural landscape in the British Isles, curling around Strangford Lough. Its MP Iris Robinson took the Chiltern Hundreds after her sexual and financial affairs with a teenage lover were revealed by a BBC documentary. The DUP took the seat from the Ulster Unionists in 2001.","The current MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries was Iris Robinson who was expelled from the DUP and resigned as an MP in January"
"297","584","Tyrone West","West_Tyrone","This large, sparsely populated seat is Northern Ireland\u2019s newest and 18th, created by the Boundary Commissioners for the 1997 general election. It has the highest levels of rural poverty and is the third most Catholic constituency, with its population concentrated in the poorer highlands and the Protestants in the valleys. It is overwhelmingly Nationalist, but had an Ulster Unionist MP for one term on its inception until the nationalists united behind Sinn Fein, who have held since 2001.","The current Sinn Fein MP for this seat is Pat Doherty"
"298","585","Ulster Mid","Mid_Ulster","The boundary changes of 1997 created a Republican Catholic constituency for the sitting MP Martin McGuinness. Previously the seat had been held by the DUP by virtue of a silent pact with the UUP, which did not stand. The mainly rural farmland is on the frontline of the struggle between the two communities. Its heartland rests in the strongly segregated villages.","The current Sinn Fein MP for this seat is Martin McGuinness"
"299","586","Upper Bann","Upper_Bann","This is a constituency of divisions as might be expected in an area of Ulster that has been central to sectarian conflict. Although it reflects the Northern Ireland balance of 43 per cent Catholic, 55 per cent Protestant, many of its towns are segregated. The violent protests of Drumcree in the Nineties, pitting Protestant Orangemen against the Catholic residents of Portadown\u2019s Garvaghy Road, remain a defining feature. The DUP gained the seat in 2005. ","The current DUP MP for this seat is David Simpson"
"300","3","Aberdeen North","Aberdeen_North","Spanning south from the River Don to Aberdeen city centre, this seat includes the university and Aberdeen\u00a0harbour, an important base for the North Sea\u00a0oil industry. The large council estates of Seaton and Hilton typify the seat, although it also includes one rural ward to the west with villages such as Kingswells. This seat had major boundary changes in 1995 and 2005. It has returned Labour MPs since 1945 despite recent support for the Scottish National Party (SNP).","The current Labour MP for this seat is Frank Doran"
"301","4","Aberdeen South","Aberdeen_South","This seat covers the southern part of Aberdeen city, with the south harbour, the low-cost housing estates of the former fishing village of Torry, and Robert Gordon University. A mixed seat, it extends to the more affluent residential suburbs of Peterculter and Cults and rural areas to the west. In the 1980s and 1990s, the seat flipped between Labour and the Conservatives, most recently switching to Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Anne Begg"
"302","5","Aberdeenshire West & Kincardine","West_Aberdeenshire_and_Kincardine","This affluent rural seat includes a stretch of coastline south of Aberdeen, where historic towns such as Stonehaven are popular with commuters. Reaching inland, the main settlements of Banchory, Aboyne, Ballater and Braemar line the River Dee. Flanked by Cairngorm Mountains such as Lochnagar and boasting attractions such as Highland Games and Balmoral Castle, this area is popular with tourists. The seat has been held by the Liberal Democrats since 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for this seat is Robert Smith"
"303","6","Airdrie & Shotts","Airdrie_and_Shotts","The town of Airdrie lies east of Glasgow and in the northern half of this seat, which is bisected by the M8 motorway. To its south is Shotts, known for its high-security prison. Both towns were once dependent on traditional industries such as steel, and have not recovered from their decline. They are working class and there is a large proportion of social housing. This seat and its predecessors have long been represented by Labour MPs, including John Smith,\u00a0the late party leader.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Dr John Reid"
"304","12","Angus","Angus","This varied Scottish seat spans the coast north of Dundee, encompassing the port towns of Montrose and Arbroath. The latter is famous for the 1320 declaration of Scottish Independence and its \u201csmokies\u201d, the haddock delicacy. Reaching inland, the seat includes the market town of Forfar, amid the agricultural land of the Strathmore Valley, and farther inland to the Grampian Mountains, where hill farming dominates the economy of the Angus Glens. The seat and its predecessors have changed hands between the SNP and Tories historically and though the nationalists have held it since 1987, their majorities have been thin.","The current SNP MP for this seat is Angus Weir"
"305","17","Argyll & Bute","Argyll_and_Bute","This seat covers a vast, remote and beautiful swathe of Scottish coastline and 26 inhabited islands including Mull, Jura and Bute. Inland, the seat reaches through Argyll moorland to the foot of the Grampians. The main towns are Oban, a ferry port, and Helensburgh, at the south of the seat and in commuter reach of Glasgow. Faslane, the base for the Trident nuclear submarine fleet, is also in the seat. It has been represented by the Tories, SNP and Liberal Democrats since the 1970s.","The current Lib Dem MP for this seat is Alan Reid"
"306","23","Ayr, Carrick & Cumnock","Ayr__Carrick_and_Cumnock","This southwest Scottish seat fans out south and east from the main coastal town of Ayr. The Doon and Afton valleys and the prosperous rural area of Carrick lie to the south, while Girvan is the other main seaside town. At the east lies Cumnock, an industrial former mining town amid the old coalfields. This is more deprived, with many living in social housing and with problems of poor health. It is traditionally a Labour area.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0","The current Labour MP for this seat is Sandra Osborne"
"307","24","Ayrshire Central","Central_Ayrshire","This southwest Scottish seat includes the prosperous seaside towns of Prestwick and Troon and some affluent rural towns. These contrast with the former mining communities that were the linchpins of the Ayrshire coalfield, and the large town of Irvine in the north. Once designated a new town to relieve pressure on social housing in nearby Glasgow, it remains working class. Labour has a comfortable majority.\u00a0","The current Labour MP for this seat is Brian Donohue"
"308","25","Ayrshire North & Arran","North_Ayrshire_and_Arran","There is a distinct divide in this constituency. To the north, the commuting towns of Skelmorlie and Largs ensure a significant Conservative vote. This is eclipsed by the south, which is firmly Labour, thanks to the industrial areas around Kilbirnie and Dalry and the mining villages of the Garnock Valley. The seat also includes the islands of Arran and Cumbrae and a stretch of the Ayrshire coastline\u00a0including Ardrossan, West Kilbride and the Hunterston nuclear power station.

Banff, Macduff and Portsoy line the north coast. In 2005, the largely farming area of Turriff was added.

To the west it has rural areas around Lennoxtown, Twechar\u00a0and Milton of Campsie, but it is largely urban and has a high\u00a0concentration of social housing. The working-class voters of Cumbernauld, 15 miles northeast of Glasgow, Kilsyth,\u00a0a former mining town, and in some wards of Kirkintilloch, make it safe for Labour.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Rosemary McKenna"
"314","207","Dumfries & Galloway","Dumfries_and_Galloway","This constituency stretches from Dumfries Burgh in the east to Stranraer and Cairnryan in the west and includes\u00a0aspects of the\u00a0Solway coastline. Labour edged it in 2005 from the Conservatives, mainly thanks to support in Dumfries, which was added to the seat. The rest of the electorate are scattered in smaller towns such as Stranraer, Newton Stewart, Castle Douglas\u00a0and Kirkcudbright.

"318","211","Dundee East","Dundee_East","This is a mostly urban seat, taking in the eastern, industrial side of Dundee. But it also contains more affluent, semi-rural areas from Angus outside the city, including the commuter-belt communities of Monifieth and Barnhill. The majority of the population is based in the city, particularly in the many large council estates. But, unlike much of Scotland, the Dundee estates are no longer solidly Labour. The Nationalists have made significant inroads and the SNP won the seat in 2005.","The current SNP MP for this seat is Stewart Hosie"
"319","212","Dundee West","Dundee_West","This always used to be a safe Labour seat. It has elected Labour MPs for the past 60 years but the Nationalists have worked hard in the area and this constituency is more of a Labour-SNP marginal than before.  The modern Dundee West constituency has a larger rural hinterland than it used to have, which has benefited the SNP. But it still retains its Labour-leaning urban base, some of which lies in the city\u2019s more deprived areas. Some of the housing is high-rise and there is a large proportion of rented social housing in this seat.","The current Labour MP for this seat is James McGovern"

The less prosperous parts of the constituency such as Pilton ensure that Labour has high levels of support.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Mark Lazarowicz"
"325","230","Edinburgh South","Edinburgh_South","This is a prosperous constituency that begins to the south of Edinburgh city centre. It takes in affluent residential areas such as Marchmont, Merchiston and Morningside as well as the more suburban Fairmilehead at the foot of the Braid\u00a0Hills.

It is held by the Liberal Democrats.","The current Lib Dem MP for this seat is Danny Alexander"

"348","406","Motherwell & Wishaw","Motherwell_and_Wishaw","This Clyde Valley constituency embodies the post-industrial character of much of central-belt Scotland. The area once thrived on heavy industry, based around Ravenscraig, but it has struggled to find a new identity since the closure of the steelworks in 1992. The constituency includes Strathclyde Country Park but the towns of Motherwell and Wishaw still dominate this North Lanarkshire seat that has been solidly Labour since the Second World War.

It has the smallest electorate in the country, about 21,000, in what is one of the largest geographic spreads. The seat stretches 130 miles from the Butt of Lewis in the north to Barra Head in the south.

It edges alongside both Perth and Stirling, containing most of the towns and villages between these two big population hubs. The seat has something of a dual personality, with the traditional Tory strongholds of Auchterarder and Crieff alongside the more working class, Labour\/SNP towns of Alloa and Alva.

Beyond this lie North Camp, Farnborough \u2013 astride the M3 and home to the famous airshow \u2013 and Blackwater. Boundary changes have removed Yateley.

The area is generally relatively well-off, with high numbers of professionals and a notable number of self-employed, especially in agriculture. Relatively minor boundary changes add the market town of Petworth and surrounding area.

Between the villages lies a mixture of farms and woodland. Many big-name manufacturers such as Nestl\u00e9 have deserted Aylesbury in the past decade and it is undergoing regeneration with extensive shopping development.

It remains a safe Conservative seat.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tony Baldry"

There is a large student population from the University of Sussex and some University of Brighton campuses and it is relatively affluent. In 1997 Labour overturned decades of Tory rule stretching back to its inception in 1950.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Lepper"
"371","108","Buckingham","Buckingham","This large, rural constituency borders Milton Keynes in the north-east; most of its employed residents commute to there or London, though local manufacturing and agriculture remain. Buckingham itself is a small market town on the Great Ouse, near the seat\u2019s northern boundary, and prides itself on green space typical of the constituency in general. Picturesque villages such as Wingrave are dotted amid the scenic countryside of the Vale of Aylesbury. This affluent seat has been Tory since 1970.","The current MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is the speaker, John Bercow, who was elected as a Conservative."
"372","125","Canterbury","Canterbury","Centred on the affluent city of Canterbury, which has England\u2019s oldest cathedral, the seat includes East Kent countryside and stretches north to the coastal resort of Whitstable, famous for its oysters. Both working and middle classes are well represented in a demographic most notable for large numbers of students and professionals working in numerous education institutions, including the University of Kent. Minor boundary changes have removed Marshside ward. The seat has long been Tory, though in recent elections the margins of victory have not always been wide.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Julian Brazier"
"373","137","Chatham & Aylesford","Chatham_and_Aylesford","This straggly Kent-Medway constituency has two distinct urban areas. The large town of Chatham dominates the north.It is separated by the M2 and a rural area from the settlements of Snodland, Larkfield, Ditton and Aylesford, grouped round the M20 in the south. Chatham, on the Medway, is working-class with patches of severe deprivation, a legacy of the closure of the naval docks. It has been designated as the centre of Medway City, planned as part of Thames Gateway regeneration. Elsewhere in the seat is much more affluent. It was a surprise win for Labour at its creation in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jonathan Shaw"
"374","142","Chesham & Amersham","Chesham_and_Amersham","Sharing the same boundaries as Chiltern District, the seat includes the pretty chalk hills which are a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It boasts excellent transport links to London \u2013 the historic market towns of Amersham and Chesham are on the Metropolitan Underground line \u2013 making it a sought-after commuter area. A large professional population enjoys the high quality of life in this affluent constituency. It has long been a Tory safe seat.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Cheryl Gillan"
"375","145","Chichester","Chichester","This large, predominantly rural West Sussex seat runs from the border with Surrey down through the South Downs to the coastal resorts of Selsey and the Witterings. The small cathedral city of Chichester and the Georgian market town of Midhurst are the main population centres. There is a cluster of settlements near the border with Havant, in the west. There are a few poorer areas on the outskirts of Chichester. It has been Conservative since 1924 and in recent years has provided support for further-right parties such as the UK Independence Party.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew Tyrie"
"376","168","Crawley","Crawley","The borders are closely drawn round the large West Sussex town of Crawley, designated a New Town in 1947, and London Gatwick airport, immediately to its north and by far the biggest source of employment. The affluent eastern half of the town contrasts with the relatively deprived south-west, where densely packed terraced houses are home to much of the town\u2019s predominantly Asian ethnic minority population. Labour took the seat comfortably from the Tories in 1997 but margins of victory narrowed in subsequent elections, down to 80 votes in 2005.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Laura Moffat"
"377","177","Dartford","Dartford","In the northwestern corner of Kent, Dartford borders on Greater London and, with its position on the south bank of the Thames, is known for the Dartford river crossings north to Essex. It is a main growth centre as part of the Thames Gateway project and site of the huge Bluewater shopping centre. Its mixed socio-economic make-up is not far from national averages, helping to explain why it has tended to change hands with the government of the day in recent decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Howard Stoate"
"378","201","Dover","Dover","Stretching from the Georgian town of Deal in the north, down the coast with its dramatic White Cliffs to just north of Folkestone, the seat focuses on the major port of Dover. This is the busiest passenger ferry port in the world, with shipping primarily crossing the channel to Calais, and it dominates the economy and employment. The seat is averagely well off, with a large working class. Labour\u2019s victory here in 1997 followed 27 years of Tory representation.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Gwyn Prosser"
"379","225","Eastbourne","Eastbourne","The East Sussex town of Eastbourne, at the foot of the South Downs, is a popular resort, boasting an impressive coast that stretches from sandy beaches to the dramatic white cliffs that have made Beachy Head a popular beauty spot \u2013 and an infamous suicide location. The seat is predominantly affluent and notable for its many retired people. Conservative dominance since the First World War was interrupted for two years in 1990, when Lib Dems took the constituency in a by-election after the murder of its MP, Ian Gow, by the IRA. The Tories regained it but margins of victory have been slim in recent elections.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nigel Waterson"
"380","226","Eastleigh","Eastleigh","From the marinas and yacht clubs of Hamble, on the Hampshire coast, the seat curves round Southampton and north to Eastleigh itself, a former railway town undergoing regeneration. The seat\u2019s many commuters generally enjoy higher salaries in Southampton than those available in the constituency. Retail is the chief economic sector and there is a sizeable working class. Lib Dems overturned decades of Tory dominance in a 1994 by-election after the infamous death of the MP, Stephen Milligan. They held on in subsequent terms but the 2001 majority was 568.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Chris Huhne"
"381","240","Epsom & Ewell","Epsom_and_Ewell","More densely populated than most of Surrey, the constituency is dominated by a chain of affluent commuter settlements running from Ashtead in the south and through Epsom, Ewell and Stoneleigh to Worcestor Park in the north. Flanked on either side by parkland and the Epsom Downs, whose racecourse is best known as the home of the Derby. The constituency has returned a Conservative MP every year since 1885.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Christopher Grayling"
"382","243","Esher & Walton","Esher_and_Walton","Named for its two principal towns \u2013 Walton-on-Thames and Esher \u2013 the constituency includes a number of affluent villages such as Cobham and Stoke D\u2019Abernon, and Hampton Court Palace in the northern end. Property prices are sky-high as the middle-class professionals who dominate the area, utilising the excellent travel connections to London, have vociferously opposed new developments. The seat has returned Tory MPs for decades.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Ian Taylor"
"383","246","Fareham","Fareham","Fareham lies on the Hampshire coast, in the northwestern tip of Portsmouth harbour. The seat encompasses the neighbouring suburban areas of Locks Heath and Warsash and is bounded by the river Hamble, a popular sailing area, in the west. Though traditionally linked to maritime industries in the nearby harbours, it is predominantly home to middle classes. The M27 runs along the top of the seat, taking commuters to Portsmouth or Southampton. Generally an affluent constituency, it has returned Tory MPs with large majorities since its inception in 1974.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Mark Hoban"
"384","247","Faversham & Kent Mid","Faversham_and_Mid-Kent","Stretching from the coast at the Swale estuary to Headcorn at its southern extremity, the seat encompasses a large rural area of the North Downs and High Weald. The medieval town of Faversham, in the north, lies amid a fruit farming area. The western border reaches the outskirts of Maidstone, where the urban cluster of Bearstead and Shepway lies by the M20 , which cuts through the seat. This area is less affluent than the countryside that surrounds it. The seat has been Tory since its inception in 1997.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Hugh Robertson"
"385","253","Folkestone & Hythe","Folkestone_and_Hythe","From the eponymous towns at the foot of the North Downs, the constituency stretches down the coast at St Mary\u2019s Bay to Dungeness at its southern tip. The Channel Tunnel car terminal is at Folkestone and the M20 runs down to the town, making it well connected. Although there are areas of deprivation in the town, the immediate surroundings are affluent. Further south, villages line the coast while inland Romney Marsh and Walland Marsh define the landscape. The personal profile of Michael Howard, MP for 1983-2005, helped to bolster the Tory vote in what had been a marginal seat.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Michael Howard"
"386","261","Gillingham & Rainham","Gillingham_and_Rainham","This densely packed urban seat lies at south of the Medway, in the north of Kent. The two towns are contrasting: Rainham is affluent and contrasts with pockets of severe deprivation in Gillingham, a legacy of the closure of the naval dockyards. Though renamed, the seat has been only marginally redrawn; the old Gillingham constituency already included Rainham. However, the loss of a less affluent area by the river is not favourable to Labour, whose win here in 1997 was dramatic following decades of Tory representation.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Paul Clark"
"387","272","Gosport","Gosport","The town of Gosport lies on the western side of Portsmouth harbour, connected to the city by regular ferry services. The seat has a long naval history and, although Haslar Royal Naval Hospital closed amid protests in 2009, the MoD still owns about a fifth of the land here. Many residents work at Portsmouth Naval Base. The well-off seat includes Lee-on-Solent, which is popular with retired people, and extends west along the coast as far as Stubbington. Held by the Tory MP Peter Viggers since 1974, he has been forced to stand down after his duck house became the most notorious symbol of the expenses scandal.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Peter Viggers"
"388","275","Gravesham","Gravesham","From Gravesend and Northfleet on the south bank of the Thames, this Kent seat stretches down toward the North Downs. The north of the constituency is predominantly urban, has patches of deprivation and forms part of the Thameside regeneration project. The rest, south of the A2, is rural, much of it Green Belt land, and generally affluent. The seat has the biggest black and minority ethnic population in Kent, the largest proportion of Indian origin. It has changed hands many times; Labour took it in 1997 but the Tories won it back in 2005.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Adam Holloway"
"389","279","Guildford","Guildford","The eponymous town is in the north of this hourglass-shaped constituency and Cranleigh, which claims to be the largest village in England, to the south. The western part of Guildford includes the University of Surrey, hospital and modern cathedral, which overlooks the River Wey to the historic central shopping area rising up the hill. The firm Tory hold since 1906 was broken in 2001 after an anti-incinerator campaign by the Lib Dems.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Anne Milton"
"390","287","Hampshire East","East_Hampshire","In dramatic boundary changes, the seat loses a large area toward Havant in the south and gains an area on the Surrey border in the north-east, a net reduction of 10,000 electors. Main settlements are the historic market towns of Alton and Petersfield and the newly-included former military town of Whitehill and Bordon, with a budding eco-town project. The urban areas are comfortably off, albeit not as affluent as surrounding countryside, much of which is within the South Downs National Park and home to many commuting professionals. Under old boundaries the constituency had a long Tory tradition.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Michael Mates"
"391","288","Hampshire North East","North_East_Hampshire","The seat has been substantially redrawn; though most of Hart district remains, it no longer includes any of East Hampshire. Instead, it extends west, flanking Basingtoke to both north and south. The M3 cuts through the centre of the seat and the main town of Fleet lies just to its south, running into Church Crookham. Other settlements include Bramley and Hook, and the Lib Dem-leaning town of Yateley, added under the most recent boundary changes. The seat remains overwhelmingly affluent and under previous boundaries had a long history of Tory representation.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is James Arbuthnot"
"392","289","Hampshire North West","North_West_Hampshire","This large rural constituency spans an area from the western outskirts of Basingstoke across to the border with Wiltshire. The main towns are Tadley, bordering on Berkshire in the northeastern extremity, and Andover, in the south-west of the seat. Other settlements include Whitchurch and Quidhampton. This is an affluent seat with a large middle class. Manufacturing and agriculture have traditionally been important sectors. It has been a safe Tory seat for decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is George Young"
"393","298","Hastings & Rye","Hastings_and_Rye","The East Sussex coastal town of Hastings, with its beach-launched fishing fleet, is the main population hub. The constituency extends east up the coast, round Rye Bay and inland to Rye itself, with its charming cobbled streets. Hastings has several areas within the 10 per cent most deprived in England. There is a relatively large working class and many self-employed; few parts of this seat are truly affluent. Its was the scene of one of Labour\u2019s most impressive seaside victories in 1997, overturning 95 years of Conservative representation.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Michael Foster"
"394","299","Havant","Havant","Just east of Portsmouth, this unusually shaped seat encompasses Hayling Island, with its beaches and traditional holiday resorts, and Havant, Emsworth and Purbrook on the mainland. A seat of contrasts, there are affluent areas along the picturesque coast but areas of severe deprivation, especially in the huge Leigh Park council housing estate. Hayling Island is particularly popular with retired people and the constituency has a large working class, with manufacturing and construction traditionally strong. There is a long tradition of Tory representation.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Willets"
"395","305","Henley","Henley","Picturesque Henley-on-Thames, famed for its royal regatta, is near the south of this physically huge constituency, which takes in expanses of sparsely populated Chiltern Hills and Oxfordshire countryside. Other towns, such as Goring and Wheatley, are popular with commuters in one of the most affluent seats in the country. It has been extended to include the Cherwell borough wards of Kirtlington and Otmoor. The seat has been Tory for decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Howell"
"396","319","Horsham","Horsham","Centred on the eponymous West Sussex town, the seat includes a substantial rural area, reaching down beyond the town of Billingshurst in the south-west and surrounding Crawley on three sides in the north-east, bordering Surrey. There are high numbers of professionals in this affluent constituency and nearby Gatwick airport is a notable employer. In 2005, the Tories\u2019 still enviable 50 per cent vote share was their lowest since 1945, albeit under varying boundaries.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Francis Maude"
"397","321","Hove","Hove","Immediately west of Brighton, Hove\u2019s stretch of seafront is defined by its multicoloured beach huts and has long been a popular resort. It is also a popular residential area, with impressive Regency architecture, and home to many professionals. Stretching inland through suburbs such as Aldrington and Mile Oak, it reaches to the foothills of the South Downs. It is generally well-off. Demographic change in recent years, with increasing student numbers, has been seen as a factor that helped Labour to overturn decades of Tory rule with its 1997 victory.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Celia Barlow"
"398","333","Isle of Wight","Isle_of_Wight","Famously having the biggest electorate of any UK parliamentary constituency, the seat contains the entire Isle of Wight. Its white cliffs, beaches and the yachting mecca of Cowes make it a prime holiday destination and its economy is directed toward tourism. Its regular ferry links to the mainland are vital. It is a popular retirement location, reflected in the ageing population. There are small patches of deprivation in the east of Newport \u2013 the main town at the centre of the island \u2013 and in Ryde in the north-east, but it is generally comfortably off. The seat has frequently changed hands between the Conservatives and Liberals, most recently being won back by the Tories in 2001 after one term of Lib Dem representation.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Andrew Turner"
"399","362","Lewes","Lewes","Centred on the eponymous town, this East Sussex constituency encompasses the surrounding rural area, at the end of the South Downs, which is generally affluent and includes such famous place names as Glyndebourne. It stretches down to the coast at Seaford and Newhaven, the latter being less well-off. About 10 per cent of residents are in social housing. There is an ageing demographic and although the middle and self-employed classes are numerous, there is a sizeable working class. Health and education are large employment sectors. A Liberal Democrat victory in 1997 overturned more than a century of Tory dominance.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Norman Baker"
"400","383","Maidenhead","Maidenhead","This seat spans the eponymous town, near Slough in the east, and Twyford and the suburban outskirts of Reading in the west. With the M4 running through the south and Heathrow airport near by, it is well-connected. The Thames forms the northern boundary and, with attractive villages, helps to make it a popular area for affluent, commuting professionals. Main employers in Maidenhead itself include Hitachi. The area has a strong Tory tradition but local issues helped the Lib Dems to reduce majorities in recent elections.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Theresa May"
"401","384","Maidstone & The Weald","Maidstone_and_the_Weald","From Maidstone at its northern extremity, this seat snakes down through the affluent mid-Kent countryside of the Weald. Boundary changes have removed Hawkhurst and Sandhurst from the south and it now finishes near Benenden, home of the famous school. Other settlements include the medieval market town of Cranbook, Staplehurst and Marden. Maidstone itself is relatively affluent with only small patches of deprivation, helping to explain decades of Conservative representation.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ann Widdecombe"
"402","391","Meon Valley","Meon_Valley","This new seat has been created by taking large chunks from the Winchester, North East and East Hampshire constituencies. Much of it falls within the South Downs National Park and, as the name indicates, the River Meon flows through the middle of the seat. The population is concentrated in Horndean and Waterlooville, near Havant in the south-east of the seat, while West Meon, Bishop\u2019s Waltham and Wickham are dotted through the countryside. Although an affluent seat, popular with commuters, its predecessors were not uniformly Tory and the Lib Dems had success in Winchester.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"403","397","Milton Keynes North","Milton_Keynes_North","A slightly redrawn constituency loses wards in the east of the town and with them the \u201cNorth East\u201d name. It now includes the entire Campbell Park ward, home to the enormous The Centre shopping and leisure complex, and some newer estates. Original areas such as Newport Pagnell remain and the constituency extends north of the M1 to include rural areas and the town of Olney. Labour narrowly took the seat from the Tories in 1997, only for it to be won back in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mark Lancaster"
"404","398","Milton Keynes South","Milton_Keynes_South","Slightly more densely populated than its northern neighbour, this seat contains many modern estates and the Second World War code-breaking centre of Bletchley. It has gained a couple of eastern wards, so bringing in the Open University, Milton Keynes\u2019s biggest single employer. As with Milton Keynes in general, the seat has a notably young population. Labour took it from the Tories in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Philyis Starkey"
"405","400","Mole Valley","Mole_Valley","At the heart of Surrey, and geographically its largest constituency, Mole Valley centres on the charming antiques haven of Dorking, at the foot of the North Downs. Its other town is Leatherhead, to the north, home to light industry and a high street once voted one of the worst in Britain. Affluent commuter villages such as Bookham, Brockham and Shere are scattered across picturesque countryside in what is still regarded as a safe Tory constituency.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Paul Beresford"
"406","409","New Forest East","New_Forest_East","The physical bulk of the seat contains much of New Forest National Park and towns such as Brockenhurst and Lyndhurs are focal points for tourism. The most densely populated areas are those concentrated along the western bank of Southampton Water: Holbury (by the huge Fawley oil refinery, an important employer), Hythe, Marchwood and Totton. Socio-economically diverse, the seat has nevertheless been resolutely Tory for decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Julian Lewis"
"407","410","New Forest West","New_Forest_West","This large, rural seat along Hampshire\u2019s border with Dorset is affluent. The population is concentrated in sought-after towns near the seafront such as Lymington, New Milton and Barton-on-Sea, while inland \u2013 just on the boundary of the New Forest National Park \u2013 lie Fordingbridge and Ringwood. The Forest and tourism are important economic sectors and there are many small-business owners. Middle-class professionals enjoy the location, in easy commuting reach of Bournemouth and Southampton. The constituency has been safely Conservative for decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Desmond Swayne"
"408","412","Newbury","Newbury","In the west of Berkshire, this large rural seat borders Oxfordshire, Wiltshire and Hampshire. The noisy M4 cuts it in two, with the main town of Newbury, neighbouring Thatcham and Hungerford in the southern half, along the Kennet and Avon Canal. Excellent transport links and pretty countryside make it popular with middle-class commuters. Vodafone headquarters are an important employer. The area is famous for horse racing and an environmental battle in 1996 over the Newbury bypass. A seat long held by Tories, a 1993 by-election gave the Lib Dems a shock victory. They held on in two general elections before Tories won it back in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Richard Benyon"
"409","443","Oxford East","Oxford_East","A constituency once defined by Cowley car plant and Blackbird Leys housing estate, and accordingly Labour-leaning, its character has been dramatically changed by the inclusion of Carfax and Holywell wards, which contain the bulk of Oxford\u2019s historic centre. The industrial fringe now shares the constituency with dreaming spires, punts on the Isis and the students who comprise a fifth of residents and who helped the Lib Dems when in the Oxford West and Abingdon seat.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew  Smith"
"410","444","Oxford West & Abingdon","Oxford_West_and_Abingdon","The seat has lost all but a handful of Oxford colleges, although it retains the smart intellectual areas of Jericho and Summertown. The constituency extends to the large, modern village of Kidlington in the north and to the historic market town of Abingdon in the south. In between lie countryside, farmland and a scattering of affluent villages, such as North and South Hinksey. It was Conservative until 1997 but tactical voting has helped the Lib Dems to retain it since.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Evan Harris"
"411","457","Portsmouth North","Portsmouth_North","This seat takes in the northern part of Portsea Island \u2013 the rows upon rows of terraced houses in North End and the warehouses and council estates of Hilsea. It includes a stretch of the mainland, where there is a marked distinction between severely deprived working-class areas in Paulsgrove and Wymering and parts of Cosham in the west, and the much more affluent Drayton and Farlington in the east. Held by the Tories in 1979-97 before being won back to Labour, the constituency has undergone slight boundary changes which have added further Tory-leaning areas.","The current Labour\/Co-op MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Sarah McCarthy-Fry"
"412","458","Portsmouth South","Portsmouth_South","The southern half of Portsea Island includes Portsmouth city centre, undergoing a \u00a3350 million redevelopment, and the historic dockyard, home to the Royal Navy \u2013 a huge employer \u2013 and the Mary Rose. The most densely populated city beyond inner London, the largely residential south-east of the seat is almost entirely comprised of terraced housing. The western half near Portsmouth harbour and docks is significantly more deprived than the east, which enjoys a seafront and beach at the mouth of Langstone harbour. Mike Hancock held this as SDP MP for 1984-87, after a by-election, and regained it from the Tories as a Liberal Democrat in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mike Hancock"
"413","464","Reading East","Reading_East","From Reading town centre, dominated by the huge Oracle shopping and leisure complex, the seat stretches out in three arms: north to Caversham; south to part of less-affluent Whitley; and east to Woodley. Part of the increasingly popular University of Reading lies in this constituency and much of the student population lives here. Otherwise, demographics are skewed toward professionals and the non-white population, which is above national average, in particular those of Pakistani origin. Labour overturned decades of Tory representation in 1997 but lost in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Robert Wilson"
"414","465","Reading West","Reading_West","From just beyond the town centre, this Berkshire seat stretches out west through suburbs such as Southcote and Calcot before reaching the increasingly rural Tilehurst and Purley-on-Thames. Beyond the conurbation the seat includes the affluent countryside around picturesque Pangbourne, by the Thames, which forms the northern boundary. To the south is an industrial area including sewage works and rugby and football stadiums. Reading has areas of some deprivation and relatively high numbers of working classes but the middle classes predominate. The seat was a surprise win for Labour in 1997 after years of Tory representation.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Martin Salter"
"415","468","Reigate","Reigate","Bisected by a designated area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the M25, the constituency includes the neighbouring towns of Reigate and Redhill to the south and Banstead village to the north. About 70 per cent is Green Belt which, combined with population growth well above the national average, makes demand for housing a key issue. This is commuter-belt territory and is a junior member of the financial services satellite towns. It has returned a Tory MP in every election since 1945.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Crispin Blunt"
"416","475","Rochester & Strood","Rochester_and_Strood","This new seat is essentially the old Medway one but now includes all of Rochester, on the eastern bank of the Medway across from Strood. The two towns, containing the bulk of the seat\u2019s residents, are a target of Thames Gateway regeneration. The physical character of the constituency means that it is sparsely populated, covering marshland and nature reserves as it stretches north to the Blyth Sands at the Thames estuary. A mixed constituency demographically of middle and working classes, it has tended to change hands with the party of government.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Bob Marshall-Andrews"
"417","478","Romsey & Southampton North","Romsey_and_Southampton_North","This large Hampshire seat is predominantly rural and largely affluent, bordering Wiltshire in the west and spreading from near Andover in the north, down the Test valley to the outskirts of Southampton in the south. Though including most the old Romsey seat, home to many commuting professionals, it has lost Chandler\u2019s Ford and Hiltingbury. The new name reflects an increased area of Swaythling added from Southampton city, including the Ford Transit van factory. Lib Dems won the old Romsey constituency in a 2000 by-election and kept it for two full terms, but in 2005 by 125 votes.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Sandra Gidley"
"418","485","Runnymede & Weybridge","Runnymede_and_Weybridge","The constituency spreads from the town of Weybridge in the south-east to Runnymede meadows in the north of the borough that is named after them. Here King John signed Magna Carta in 1215. Affluent commuter settlements that crowd round the M25-M3 interchange include Egham, Chertsey, Virginia Water and Thorpe, site of an industrial estate and eponymous theme park. Prettier rural areas are to be found in the south-west of this Conservative safe seat.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Philip Hammond"
"419","502","Sevenoaks","Sevenoaks","This Kent seat borders East London and is criss-crossed by the M25, M20 and M26. The main town of Sevenoaks lies near the south of the seat and, like the settlements in the rural North Downs surrounding it, is generally extremely affluent. Swanley, in the northwestern tip, is the other main town, slightly less affluent. The constituency if typified by middle-class professionals living in detached houses, commuting to work in London. It has been represented by the Tories since 1924.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Michael Fallon"
"420","512","Sittingbourne & Sheppey","Sittingbourne_and_Sheppey","This north Kent seat combines the Isle of Sheppey with the mainland area round Sittingbourne, from which it is divided by the Swale. Relative deprivation is evident in much of Sheppey and in small patches of Sittingbourne, but the mainland is generally better off. The seat has been slightly increased and now includes all of Teynham and Lynsted. Labour won in this formerly Tory area at the seat\u2019s inception in 1997 but by 2005 its majority had fallen to 75.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Derek Wyatt"
"421","515","Slough","Slough","\u201cCome, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough\u201d, implored John Betjeman in 1937. The industry he despised has diversified but the Berkshire town is typified by grey housing estates, once a London overspill, and concrete office blocks. It struggles to shake off the soulless image of television\u2019s The Office, despite regeneration attempts. The Mars bar was invented here; other big employers in a productive town with excellent links to London and Heathrow airport include O2 and Ferrari. The non-white population is 40 per cent; the largest communities are Indian and Pakistani and there are the highest number of Sikhs in Britain. Labour overturned three terms of Tory representation in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Fiona Mactaggart"
"422","523","Southampton Itchen","Southampton__Itchen","Spanning the mouth of the River Itchen, the constituency contains the city centre on the western bank, including Eastern Docks, the retail and commercial hub and two university campuses. Stretching further up the eastern bank of the Itchen, it covers a larger residential area, including suburbs such as Woolston, Sholing and Bitterne. This is predominantly a working-class area with some deprivation but the city has undergone extensive regeneration. The seat last changed hands when Labour regained it by a narrow majority in 1992 after two Tory terms.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Denham"
"423","524","Southampton Test","Southampton__Test","The western half of Southampton is in this seat, which runs along the River Test in the south. The waterfront is predominantly used by the Western Docks; Southampton is the cruise departure capital of Britain and a leading deep-water container port, especially for vehicle import and export (Ford Transit vans are produced just beyond the northern boundary). Inland, the seat encompasses suburbs such as Shirley and takes in Southampton Common and the main University of Southampton campus \u2013 there is a large student population. The constituency was Tory for 1979-97.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Alan Whitehead"
"424","527","Spelthorne","Spelthorne","In the northern tip of Surrey, this densely-populated urban constituency is atypical of the county, although it shares the commuter-driven high house prices. The settlements of Ashford, Shepperton, Staines, Stanwell and Sunbury sprawl across most of Spelthorne and about 30 per cent is flood plain or reservoir. Just south of Heathrow, the airport and associated sectors employ about a quarter of the working population. The seat has been Tory for decades, although majorities dipped in 1997.","The current Tory MP for this seat is David Wilshire"
"425","552","Surrey East","East_Surrey","In the eastern extremity of Surrey, bordering Kent, the constituency comprises the town of Horley and district of Tandridge, which boasts about 90 per cent Green Belt land. The towns of Caterham and Oxted and villages such as Godstone lie amid agricultural land, woodland and open countryside. Half the working population commutes out, including many to Crawley and Gatwick airport, the biggest single employer. A Tory stronghold since 1918, even in 1997 the party took over 50 per cent of the vote.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Peter Ainsworth"
"426","553","Surrey Heath","Surrey_Heath","In the west of the county, bordering Hampshire and Berkshire, the constituency is named for its extensive rural areas but is home to the sizeable towns of Camberley and Frimley, and Chobham, Bagshot and Ash. There is a strong military presence because of Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, just beyond the northern boundary, and Deepcut Barracks, due for closure in about 2013. Frimley Green hosts the World Darts Championships. This is a safe Tory seat.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Michael Gove"
"427","554","Surrey South West","South_West_Surrey","Much of Waverley borough is included in a constituency that borders Sussex and Hampshire and features the Devil\u2019s Punchbowl, a dramatic heathland hollow. The historic market towns of Farnham, Godalming and Haslemere, affluent commuter hubs, lie at the periphery. The centre remains rural, with a third covered by woodland. Once regarded as safe for the Tories, in 2001 they had less than a 2 per cent margin over the Lib Dems, who retained a reasonable presence in 2005 but have since lost popularity over local disputes.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jeremy Hunt"
"428","555","Sussex Mid","Mid_Sussex","Though this seat is in West Sussex, the name reflects its border with East Sussex. The three main towns, dotted amid the countryside, are Haywards Heath, Burgess Hill and East Grinstead, which lies at the border with Surrey in the north. The constituency has been slightly extended west to take in Bolney and surrounding area. This is classic commuter-belt territory for London and Brighton. Generally affluent, it is home to many professionals and middle classes, mostly owner-occupiers, and a service sector dominates the economy. It has long been represented by Conservatives.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nicholas Soames"
"429","567","Thanet North","North_Thanet","From the resort of Margate, the seat stretches along the North Kent coast as far as Herne Bay, with its brightly-coloured beach huts, encompassing the north-western half of Thanet district and wards within Canterbury authority. Other settlements include Westgate, Birchington, Beltinge and Minster, and Kent International Airport is in the seat. Boundary changes have removed Cliftonville from the east. Health and social work is an important sector and the seat is notable for a high number of retired people. There is a long Tory tradition.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Roger Gale"
"430","568","Thanet South","South_Thanet","This constituency could more accurately be called East Thanet, stretching as it does along the easternmost coastal fringe of Kent, encompassing Ramsgate, Broadstairs and \u2013 since boundary changes \u2013 Cliftonville from Thanet district. It includes a rural area from Dover district, to the south beyond the River Stour, around the well-preserved medieval town of Sandwich. The huge Pfizer pharmaceutical company is a leading employer. The seat was once seen as safely Tory but Labour ousted a disgraced Jonathan Aitken in 1997 and held on with narrowing majorities in the subsequent two terms.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen Ladyman"
"431","573","Tonbridge & Malling","Tonbridge_and_Malling","From Edenbridge in the southwestern corner of Kent, by the border with Surrey and Sussex, the seat curves east to Tonbridge and Hildenborough, and then north to the M20 and beyond. West and East Malling give their name to the predominantly rural northern area, which includes Mereworth Woods. GlaxoSmithKline, near Leigh in the south, is an important employer. It is generally an affluent seat and popular with commuters, although 15 per cent of residents live in social housing. The constituency has been safely Tory for generations.","The current Tory MP for this seat is John Stanley"
"432","580","Tunbridge Wells","Tunbridge_Wells","The spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells lies at Kent\u2019s border with East Sussex, from where the seat stretches south-east along the county boundary as far as the villages of Hawkhurst and Sandhurst, newly included after boundary changes. It includes Paddock Wood. Tourism is a notable sector in this affluent seat and the pretty villages amid High Weald countryside are popular with commuters. The constituency has long been a Tory stronghold.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Greg Clark"
"433","597","Wantage","Wantage","Much of the rolling countryside in the Vale of the White Horse \u2013 including the prehistoric chalk equine itself \u2013 lies within Wantage constituency, named after the small town at its centre. The seat takes in Faringdon and two south Oxfordshire towns: Wallingford, a pretty market town, and Didcot, whichlike Wantage has been earmarked for significant development. The seat has been safely Tory since the Second World War.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ed Vaizey"
"434","606","Wealden","Wealden","A large and generally affluent seat, Wealden encompasses the heart of East Sussex. From the border with Kent in the north it stretches down through High Weald, taking in Crowborough, Uckfield and, at its south, the less well-off Hailsham. Under boundary changes it has lost the town of Heathfield. There are above-average numbers of professionals and large numbers of self-employed \u2013 much of the land is given over to agriculture, although the sector no longer dominates employment. There is a long history of Tory representation.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Charles Hendry"
"435","622","Winchester","Winchester","The small city of Winchester, with its cathedral and prestigious school, sits at the heart of Hampshire amid countryside dotted with picturesque villages. Dramatic boundary changes to make way for the new Meon Valley constituency have almost halved this seat\u2019s area, losing a large rural district. The electorate has been cut by only 12,000 because Chandler\u2019s Ford and Hiltingbury, in the southern tip, are added. An overwhelmingly white, middle-class seat, traditionally Tory, it was won by the Lib Dems in 1997. Mark Oaten has announced that he is standing down after a sex scandal in 2006.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mark Oaten"
"436","623","Windsor","Windsor","Stretching from the M25 to Bracknell Forest, this constituency encompasses areas synonymous with upper-class wealth: Windsor, with its medieval royal castle, Eton, with Britain\u2019s most famous school, and Ascot, of racecourse fame. It contains the Household Cavalry\u2019s Combermere barracks and Windsor Great Park. Residents are overwhelmingly affluent and work in the service sector \u2013 some campaigned for a new postcode to disassociate themselves from Slough, across the M4. House prices are sky-high as ex-Londoners snap up its Victorian housing stock, despite its position beneath Heathrow flight paths. There is a long Tory tradition, although the Lib Dems have enjoyed some success locally.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Adam Afriyie"
"437","627","Witney","Witney","Witney\u2019s political fame rests on David Cameron, the Conservative Party leader, who is its MP. The seat had turned Labour against its will in 1999 when Shaun Woodward, the incumbent Tory, defected to Labour. When he moved to represent another constituency in 2001, Witney elected Mr Cameron and re-elected him in 2005, with 49 per cent of the votes. Witney town is largely residential and industrial but the wider constituency boasts beautiful scenery, Cotswold stone cottages and Blenheim Palace. The RAF base at Brize Norton is a notable feature and other towns include Woodstock and Chipping Norton.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Cameron"
"438","628","Woking","Woking","The largest town in Surrey has been heavily developed in recent decades and gives its name to this constituency, which includes Byfleet and Pirbright, where there are military barracks. The constituency is mainly affluent commuter territory, although the Sheerwater estate, which houses more than 1,300 families and an unusually high ethnic population for Surrey, is deprived even by national standards. The Lib Dems have made progress but it remains a safe Tory seat.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Humphrey Malins"
"439","629","Wokingham","Wokingham","This Berkshire constituency spans the rural area south of Reading but the population is concentrated in the east, in an area criss-crossed by motorways. It encompasses the eastern tip of the Reading conurbation, with Earley, Sindlesham, Winnersh, part of the University of Reading and Wokingham itself. With high numbers of professionals and few manual labourers, this affluent seat has a long history of returning Tory MPs.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Redwood"
"440","638","Worthing East & Shoreham","East_Worthing_and_Shoreham","Just west of Brighton, this coastal seat encompasses only the eastern fringe of Worthing, with its trading estates, and stretches along the coast through Sompting and Lancing to Shoreham-by-Sea and Southwick. Typically for resorts with seasonal tourism employment, much of the seafront area is relatively poor, though there is little serious deprivation. Further inland there are more affluent patches. The constituency has above-average numbers of retired people and health is a prominent economic sector. It has returned Tory MPs since its inception in 1997.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tim Loughton"
"441","639","Worthing West","Worthing_West","As well as encompassing most of the large seaside town of Worthing, complete with pier, this West Sussex seat stretches along the coast through Goring-by-Sea, Ferring and East Preston to Rustington at its western extremity. It is the more affluent of the Worthing seats, with only a few patches of deprivation. The working population is chiefly in the service sector \u2013 notably health, because of its hospital \u2013 but the seat is most notable for the large number of retired people, who have helped to ensure that it returned Tory MPs in recent years.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Peter Bottomley"
"442","642","Wycombe","Wycombe","The M40 neatly slices this Buckinghamshire constituency in two, with High Wycombe to the north and largely rural areas dotted with villages to the south. RAF High Wycombe is the headquarters of Air Command. There is a sizeable amount of light industry and manufacturing in High Wycombe but it is an affluent constituency, enjoying the natural beauty of the Chiltern Hills, and has little council housing. The ethnic minority population is more than twice the national average and there is a large Muslim community. A safe Tory seat, it withstood even Labour\u2019s 1997 onslaught \u2013 albeit with reduced majorities.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Paul Goodman"
"443","36","Bath","Bath","This seat has been redrawn to encompass just the city and exclude rural areas north and east. Famous for the only natural thermal waters in Britain, 15th century abbey and Georgian stone crescents, Bath is a Unesco World Heritage Site. Tourism generates \u00a3195 million annually. Despite low unemployment, Bath is city of contrasts. Much of it is in Britain\u2019s 20 per cent least deprived areas but some parts of Twerton and Abbey wards fall into the bottom 20 per cent. Lib Dems took it from the Tories in 1992.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Don Foster"
"444","82","Bournemouth East","Bournemouth_East","This small, urban seat includes most of the award-winning Bournemouth beach and large residential areas include above-average numbers of retired people. It is relatively affluent but Central Boscombe is in the top 1 per cent of deprived areas in Britain. Boscombe has constructed an artificial surf reef to increase tourism, already a large employer. Bournemouth is the biggest destination outside London for foreign students learning English. Finance and service are the other main sectors. Tory since the seat\u2019s creation, the margins of victory have not always been great.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tobias Ellwood"
"445","83","Bournemouth West","Bournemouth_West","A 2007 survey identified Bournemouth as the happiest place in Britain. The town centre is included in this seat, which has been redrawn to include wards from neighbouring Poole borough \u2013 Branksome East and Alderney, where there are large social housing estates. Kinson South is also relatively deprived but this seaside seat is generally fairly affluent, with residents working in finance, business and tourism. It has a staunchly Tory tradition.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Butterfill"
"446","95","Bridgwater & Somerset West","Bridgwater_and_West_Somerset","The old Bridgwater constituency has been extended, reflected in the new name. It encompasses some of the best and worst of Somerset, from Exmoor and the Quantock and Brendon hills to the industrial town of Bridgwater, with its services on the M5. Other towns include Minehead and Watchet, along the lengthy stretch of coastline, and the area is reliant on tourism as well as agriculture. There are a large number of retired people and the seat has a long Tory tradition.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ian Liddell-Grainger"
"447","99","Bristol East","Bristol_East","This long, thin seat is bounded by the M32 at the north and stretches down the east of the city centre, reaching south beyond Brislington. It is predominantly residential, with only a few commercial parks, and is averagely well-off; it has neither the deprivation of Bristol South nor the affluence of Bristol West. About 10 per cent of residents are ethnic minorities, concentrated in Eastville ward. The stronghold of Tony Benn during 1950to 1983, it fell to the Tories until 1992, when Labour regained it.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Kerry McCarthy"
"448","100","Bristol North West","Bristol_North_West","Docks at Avonmouth are the main focus of Bristol\u2019s maritime industries, divided from the rest of the constituency by the M5. Most of the seat is residential, though less densely populated than the rest of the city, with a smattering of green spaces. Boundary changes have removed the Stoke Gifford area and now include Stoke Bishop, nearer the city centre. Though this area and Canford are prosperous, elsewhere there is deprivation, especially on the Lawrence Weston council estate. The seat changed hands with the past two changes of government.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Doug Naysmith"
"449","101","Bristol South","Bristol_South","The south of Bristol contains its most deprived areas; there are large social housing estates at Knowle West and Hartcliffe. This is a poor, white and working-class seat with a crime rate and unemployment that are both high, although the areas at the very north of the constituency, near the redeveloped Harbourside, boast more sought-after modern apartments. The seat has been Labour since the Second World War.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Dawn Primarolo"
"450","102","Bristol West","Bristol_West","The heart of Bristol city lies in this seat, including the old industrial Floating Harbourside, now redeveloped with public squares and the financial centre \u2013 HBOS and Lloyds banks have bases hit by job cuts. Some of the city\u2019s most affluent areas are here, with multimillion-pound Victorian, Georgian and Regency houses. Lawrence Hill estate and Easton Road are in Britain\u2019s worst 1 per cent areas of deprivation. Once a Tory seat, it was taken by Labour in 1997 and Lib Dems in 2005.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen Williams"
"451","118","Camborne & Redruth","Camborne_and_Redruth","Cambourne, Pool and Redruth form a five-mile urban corridor parallel to the west coast of Cornwall. Once prosperous from copper and tin mining, the area declined so much in 2000-06 that it qualified for funding as one of the poorest parts of the EU. Now a backwater in a county where tourism has supplanted industry \u2013 holidaymakers flock to the golden sands of St Ives Bay \u2013 the future may brighten from plans to resume tin mining. The seat has changed hands between all three main parties.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Julia Goldsworthy"
"452","141","Cheltenham","Cheltenham","Famous for its racecourse, Ladies\u2019 College and location on the edge of the Cotswold Hills, Cheltenham has a large tourism sector. GE Aviation is a big employer and GCHQ, the government communications centre, is here, so numbers of professionals are well above the national average. One of the West\u2019s most upmarket towns, the few less well-off spots are in the social housing area of Hesters Way. About one in ten residents are students at the University of Gloucestershire. Liberal Democrats overturned decades of Tory representation in 1992.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Martin Horwood"
"453","147","Chippenham","Chippenham","Poaching from the North Wiltshire, Devizes and old Westbury seats, boundary changes have given this large town its own seat, the most densely populated in Wiltshire. Blighted or blessed, depending on your view, by a prime location in the M4 corridor, this south Cotswolds area is popular with commuters working as far away as Reading in the east and Cardiff in the west. Bradford-on-Avon is an attractive village that has become a traffic bottle-neck. The seats from which this one was made were Tory.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"454","150","Christchurch","Christchurch","This coastal constituency lies on the eastern bank of the Stour, which divides Christchurch from the main Bournemouth and Poole conurbation. In Christchurch itself some 35 per cent of people are 60 or over and there is one of the highest proportions of retired people in Britain. The aerospace and tourist industries are significant employers. It has been solidly Conservative except for a dramatic 1993 by-election, when the Lib Dems won by 16,000 after the death of an MP whose majority was 23,000 the previous year.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Christopher Chope"
"455","162","Cornwall North","North_Cornwall","Dramatic boundary changes mean this seat loses Newquay \u2013 and about 20,000 electors. Bodmin, the largest town in North Cornwall, is \u201cGateway to the Moor\u201d, with its windswept, rugged landscape. Padstow is known as Padstein after the chef Rick Stein, whose culinary empire dominates the former fishing village. Bude lies to the north on a coastline whose beaches attract hordes of visitors. Tourism and dairy farming are important. Cornwall received EU funding for 2000-06 to boost its economy. The constituency changed hands numerous times before being won by Lib Dems in 1992.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Dan Rogerson"
"456","163","Cornwall South East","South_East_Cornwall","The main towns are Liskeard, in the centre, and Saltash and Torpoint, which sit across the Tamar estuary from Devon and Plymouth, whose Devonport docks are a major employer. The Cornwall coastline draws tourists and retired people, while agriculture is also a notable economic sector. The most famous landmark is the Royal Albert Bridge created by the Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Boundary changes have removed St Blaise and Stoke Climsland. The Lib Dems overturned 27 years of Tory representation with their victory in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Colin Breed"
"457","164","Cotswolds, The","The_Cotswolds","This affluent seat covers a huge area of the beautiful Cotswold hills and quintessential English countryside dotted with picturesque villages. Cirencester, self-proclaimed Capital of the Cotswolds, lies near the south while the other main towns are Moreton-in-Marsh, Stow-on-the-Wold and Bourton-on-the-Water. Unsurprisingly, tourism is a large part of the economy and agriculture remains important. Boundary changes, adding Minchinhampton ward, are as minor as the change to the name, which used to be just Cotswold. The Conservatives have dominated this seat and its predecessors.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Geoffrey Clifton-Brown"
"458","187","Devizes","Devizes","The old constituency has been cut by more than 18,000 electors, removing Calne and Melksham. The new one is predominantly rural, with Devizes near the west and Marlborough by the downs to the north \u2013 this town has one of Britain\u2019s widest high streets. Kennet and Avon Canal cuts through the centre of the seat. Tidworth, at the south, is a military town and boundary changes add further army bases in nearby villages. Large areas of Salisbury Plain are used for military training. The seat has been Tory since 1945.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Michael Ancram"
"459","188","Devon Central","Central_Devon","The new, land-locked constituency takes roughly a third from each of the Mid Devon, Teighbridge and West Devon boroughs, plus East Devon Exe Valley ward. There is substantial agriculture in a rural seat hit hard by the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic, when culling of uninfected herds caused almost as much misery as the disease. Tourism focuses on Dartmoor and thatched villages. The main town, Okehampton, is gateway to an army training camp. The area has a mixed history of Lib Dem and Tory support.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"460","189","Devon East","East_Devon","Redrawn almost beyond recognition, the constituency retains its name despite losing the eastern tip of Devon. It gains outer Exeter and is geographically compact, the western boundary following the Exe down to Devon\u2019s biggest town, Exmouth. East lie the resort of Sidmouth and historic Ottery St Mary. Residents are generally affluent \u2013 and ageing: about one in three is 65 or over. Scavengers from across Britain descended on Branscombe beach when a freighter ran aground in 2007, deposting car parts and BMW motorcycles. The old seat had been Tory since 1945.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Hugo Swire"
"461","190","Devon North","North_Devon","North Devon is a rural constituency with significant agriculture and villages dotted around the rugged countryside. The main town and commercial centre is Barnstaple, which claims to be the oldest borough in Britain. Tourism is a big employer, benefiting from a long coastline with dramatic cliffs and sands that include award-winning Woolacombe beach. Two RAF search-and-rescue Sea King helicopters fly from the Royal Marine Base at Chivenor. The seat has alternated from Tory to Liberal, most recently being won by the Lib Dems in 1992.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nick Harvey"
"462","191","Devon South West","South_West_Devon","From Dartmoor, at the north of the constituency, the river Erme tumbles down through the busy market town of Ivybridge, emerging onto a stretch of coastline that is less reliant on tourism than that in the neighbouring Totnes seat. Many commuters reside in the western end of South Hams and in the generally affluent red-brick settlements of Plympton and Plymstock, on the outskirts of Plymouth. The seat has returned Tory MPs with sizeable majorities in recent decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Gary Streeter"
"463","192","Devon West & Torridge","Torridge_and_West_Devon","Stretching north from the outskirts of Plymouth to Bideford Bay, this huge constituency contains much of Dartmoor and a distinctly rural character, with significant agriculture and many self-employed residents. Visitors flock to the private 16th century village of Clovelly, Lundy Island (resident population about 18) and Westward Ho!, the only place name in Britain with an exclamation mark. Once a safe Tory seat, voters embraced their MP\u2019s defection to the Lib Dems in 1995 and elected another Lib Dem at the next two elections, before the Tories won it back in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Geoffrey Cox"
"464","197","Dorset Mid & Poole North","Mid_Dorset_and_North_Poole","A largely rural area north of Purbeck district, at the west, contrasts with more densely populated areas such as Corfe Mullen and Broadstone, on the outskirts of Poole at the east. Wimborne Minster lies at the seat\u2019s north-eastern corner and is newly included following boundary changes. This is generally a fairly affluent constituency that is economically active, with sizeable working and middle classes. Only about one in ten people live in social housing. The seat was taken from the Tories by the Lib Dems in 2001.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Annette Brooke"
"465","198","Dorset North","North_Dorset","This large rural seat has problems of remoteness and poor access for half the population, who live in villages. In the market towns of Blandford, Shaftesbury and Gillingham population growth is high. The seat has one of the highest proportions of retired people but also higher numbers of young people than the rest of Dorset because of several boarding schools and an armed forces base. The seat has been held by the Tories since 1950 but margins of victory over Lib Dems in recent elections were sometimes narrow.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Robert Walter"
"466","199","Dorset South","South_Dorset","The densely populated coastal town of Weymouth and the Isle of Portland lie at the west of a constituency that arcs round Weymouth Bay to the rural Isle of Purbeck, with Swanage at the east. Weymouth is one of the least affluent towns in Dorset and the remote Isle of Purbeck has an ageing population. Second-home ownership leaves some villages all but deserted in winter and prices out young families. The Jurassic Coast and Corfe Castle are tourist attractions. Long a Tory seat, Labour took it in 2001.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Jim Knight"

Other towns are Bridport \u2013 some of Britain\u2019s best fish and chips are sold from seafront huts \u2013 Sherborne and Dorchester. East lies Chesil Beach, an 18-mile shingle bank formed after the ice ages. Most of the countryside is a designated Area of Outstanding Beauty. In some coastal parishes, one in five houses are second homes and the population is ageing. Tories have held the seat since 1945 but recent victories over the Lib Dems were narrow.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Oliver Letwin"
"468","244","Exeter","Exeter","All but two Exeter city wards are in the constituency, bisected by the Exe. The commercial centre climbs up the hill to the historic cathedral, which stands out in a city mostly rebuilt after wartime bombing. Regeneration brought the \u00a3230 million Princesshay shopping and leisure complex, opened in 2007. Parliament Street is officially the narrowest in Britain. The Met Office is the biggest employer in a largely service sector economy and university students form about a tenth of residents. The seat has been Labour only since 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ben Bradshaw"
"469","251","Filton & Bradley Stoke","Filton_and_Bradley_Stoke","This new South Gloucestershire seat has a rural area northwest of the M5. The inner area is urban, centred on the Filton suburb of Bristol, a large employment centre. Pioneers built aircraft there before the First World War, a tradition represented by BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Airbus. From other constituencies have come the modern town of Bradley Stoke, social housing estates in Patchway and, south-east around the M32-M4 junction, the affluent village of Winterbourne and Victorian terraced suburb of Staple Hill. This has been a bellwether seat since 1950.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"470","254","Forest of Dean","Forest_of_Dean","From the border with Wales at the south-west, the constituency stretches up to Worcestershire in the north. Bounded by the Severn to the east, the Forest of Dean is overwhelmingly rural. Main towns include Lydney, Coleford and Newent. The Forest has a reputation for strange goings-on \u2013 one priest warned parishioners not to dabble in the occult. Once driven by mining, the economy is dominated by small businesses and low-wage, seasonal employment in tourism. A quarter of residents commute to work elsewhere. Tories held the seat from 1979 to 1997 and regained it from Labour in 2005.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Mark Harper"
"471","270","Gloucester","Gloucester","With its Victorian dock and a cathedral featured in the Harry Potter films, tourism is big business in the city of Gloucester. Traditional manufacturing dependence has diversified and the financial sector is strong. Yet this is the most deprived district in Gloucestershire, with particular deprivation in Barton and Westage. Under boundary changes the seat has been slightly cut, with the loss of the more affluent Longlevens ward. The ethnic minority population of 7.5 per cent is high for the area. The seat was Conservative from 1970 to 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Parmjit Dhanda"
"472","344","Kingswood","Kingswood","Though retaining its name, the constituency has been redrawn, losing the City of Bristol wards of Frome Vale and Hillfields but still covering the city\u2019s fringes. Kingswood is an old industrial town with a coal mining heritage. It is a mix of Victorian terraces and newer estates, with social and private housing. The eastern edge of the seat just reaches into rural land with the relatively affluent villages of Upton Cheney and Siston. A large science park is planned for Emersons Green. The seat switched to Labour in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Roger Berry"
"473","420","Newton Abbot","Newton_Abbot","The old Teignbridge constituency is replaced by a much smaller seat \u2013 20,000 fewer electors \u2013 that takes in the coast between Exmouth and Torbay. The market town of Newton Abbott, on the Teign estuary, is the main retail centre and site of a racecourse. The 22 miles of coast are the focus of a growing tourism industry and much of the area remains rolling Devon countryside. High numbers of retired people produce an ageing demographic. The old seat was safely Tory until taken by the Lib Dems in 2001.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Richard Younger-Ross"
"474","452","Plymouth Moor View","Plymouth_Moor_View","The seat retains the bulk of the old Plymouth Devonport constituency but has been renamed after the eastern Moor View ward since the loss of Devonport, with its naval base. Large housing estates and maritime related industries define the constituency, whose traditional fisheries and military economies have been in long-term decline. Unemployment levels are some of the highest in the region and the constituency has been Labour since 1992, when the former Social Democrat leader David Owen, who had held the seat for 18 years, stood down.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Alison Seabeck"
"475","453","Plymouth Sutton & Devonport","Plymouth_Sutton_and_Devonport","The seat takes in Plymouth\u2019s modern centre and touristy waterfront, from whose Mayflower Steps the Pilgrim Fathers sailed for America. Redrawn, it includes Devonport dockyard, home to Europe\u2019s largest naval base and responsible for 10 per cent of the city\u2019s income. The Government has repeatedly insisted that the dockyard, which directly or indirectly supports 24,000 jobs, is secure, despite persistent closure rumours. Residential wards vary from the more affluent Stoke and Compton to the housing estates of Efford. Under varying boundaries, the seat was Tory before Labour took it in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Linda Gilroy"
"476","455","Poole","Poole","Poole town centre runs from the quay, where old merchant houses adjoin modern buildings, to the Dolphin shopping centre. Alongside commerce and the marine industry \u2013 Poole is home to the Special Boat Service \u2013 are large residential areas of varied character. Sandbanks, at the entrance to the world\u2019s second largest natural harbour, was recently valued as the world\u2019s fourth most expensive property area. The constituency has lost Branksome East ward but gains Creekmoor. Regeneration is due, with planned construction of the Twin Sails Bridge. The seat has been Tory since 1950.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Robert Syms"
"477","491","St Austell & Newquay","St_Austell_and_Newquay","St Austell, just inland on the southern coast of Cornwall, was previously grouped with Truro. The redrawn constituency extends north-west to the busy tourist resort and surfing centre of Newquay. St Austell has undergone multimillion-pound regeneration in the Aylmer Square area and is a tourist hub because of the nearby Eden Project. The seat includes the well-preserved Georgian harbour at Charlestown, which frequently appears on film and television. More than one in five residents are pensioners. The previous seat returned Liberal MPs since 1974.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"478","494","St Ives","St_Ives","The seat curves round Mounts Bay on Cornwall\u2019s south coast, stretching from Lands End, the most westerly point in England, to Lizard Point, the most southerly. Penzance and numerous fishing villages nestle in the bay while, on the northern coast, St Ives sits on its eponymous bay. It still attracts artists for its luminous light and turquoise seas but is overrun with tourists. The constituency includes the Isles of Scilly. Nearly 50 per cent of constituents are aged 45 or over. The Lib Dems took this former Tory stronghold in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew George"
"479","496","Salisbury","Salisbury","The city of Salisbury is a big tourist destination for its cathedral, medieval centre and proximity to Stonehenge. It is the commercial centre of an otherwise largely rural seat. A military base at Wilton is due for closure in 2010 but military training will continue on Salisbury Plain. Chalk downs dipping down to dense woodland are a feature of the south-east. The seat has returned Tories since 1945. Sir Edward Heath, the former Conservative prime minister, was a long-time resident of one of the grandest homes in Cathedral Close.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Robert Key"
"480","517","Somerset North","North_Somerset","Though a tiny boundary change adds an extra 181 electors (as of the last census), this is essentially the old Woodspring seat with a new name. A coastal strip between the Severn Estuary and the M5 includes the towns of Clevedon and Portishead, while inland from the motorway is Nailsea and a predominantly rural area dotted with villages. This is a fairly affluent constituency with about a third of the population commuting to work, mostly in Bristol and Bath. The old seat returned Tory MPs. ","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Liam Fox"
"481","518","Somerset North East","North_East_Somerset","Largely the old Wansdyke seat, it no longer contains any south Gloucestershire wards and instead encircles the city of Bath seat. Only a third of the population lives in urban areas: Midsomer Norton, a traditional market town on the River Somer, neighbouring Radstock, a former coal-mining town, and Keynsham, on the outskirts of Bristol. The rest of the constituency is rural, with the gentle hills of Chew Valley a particularly affluent area. The economy is strong. Once seen as safely Tory, the seat was won by Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Dan Norris"
"482","519","Somerton & Frome","Somerton_and_Frome","From Wincanton at the centre of the seat, one arm extends north to Frome \u2013 pronounced Froom \u2013 which boasts more than 500 listed buildings, more than Bath has. Another branch extends west to Somerton and beyond. Tweaks to the boundaries include gaining Baltonsborough and Butleigh and losing Ivelchester. The seat is largely rural, with agricultural land, especially around Blackmoor Vale, that gives rise to food and dairy businesses. The constituency has returned Lib Dems with narrow victories since they first won by 130 votes in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Heath"
"483","546","Stroud","Stroud","The constituency reaches well beyond Stroud town to the River Severn at the west and Cotswold hills at the east, and is bisected by the M5. The population is concentrated in Stroud, Cam, Dursley and Wotton-under-Edge, former wool mill areas. Stroud town has a bohemian reputation, boasts Britain\u2019s first fully-organic caf\u00e9 and has had local Green Party success. Laurie Lee\u2019s Cider with Rosie was set in the Slad Valley. The economy is based on small businesses, including dairy farming. It was Conservative for 40 years until the Labour landslide of 1997.","The current Labour\/Co-op MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Drew"
"484","560","Swindon North","North_Swindon","At the northern extremity of Wiltshire, this seat has been redrawn slightly, losing Cricklade. It includes a small rural area round Highworth but is mostly north of Swindon. Honda and BMW have factories, hard hit by the recession, and there are many more industrial and trading estates. Penhill has a large social housing estate and the constituency is relatively working class. Swindon is due to become Britain\u2019s first \u201cwireless city\u201d supplying free broadband to every home. The seat was won by Labour at its creation in 1997. ","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Michael Wills"
"485","561","Swindon South","South_Swindon","Swindon\u2019s town centre in this seat, developed with the arrival of the Great Western Railway in 1840 and undergoing regeneration. The Old Town is a sought-after residential area. The Parks and Walcott areas have large social housing estates. A mixed economy includes heavy manufacturing, light engineering and commercial and financial sectors. The M4 cuts through the seat, dividing Swindon from a more rural area to the south. The constituency had a long Labour tradition and the party regained it in 1997 after a 14-year Tory interlude.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Anne Snelgrove"
"486","564","Taunton Deane","Taunton_Deane","Having lost a large rural area from West Somerset, the old Taunton seat has been renamed to match the borough with which it now shares a boundary. Project Taunton is a \u00a31billion regeneration scheme to build 18,000 homes, much needed as prices outstrip incomes. Wellington is the other main town. The rest of the constituency is rural, with the Blackdown, Brendon and Quantock hills and a small farming sector. Once solidly Conservative, the seat was won by the Lib Dems in 1997, Tories in 2001 and Lib Dems again in 2005.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jeremy Browne"
"487","566","Tewkesbury","Tewkesbury","The M5 runs through this semi-rural constituency, from the suburban sprawl between Cheltenham and Gloucester at the south to the historic riverside town of Tewkesbury at the north. An affluent seat, it is home to many highly qualified commuters working for such companies as Group 4 Securities and enjoys beautiful countryside and good transport links. Flooding devastated large areas of the seat in 2007. The constituency has been Conservative since the Second World War.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Laurence Robertson"
"488","570","Thornbury & Yate","Thornbury_and_Yate","This new constituency covers most of the old Northavon seat but loses a stretch of coast around Severn Beach. It retains the Severn Bridge, which takes the M48 to Wales. The main population centres are: Thornbury, an attractive and fairly affluent market town with new estates on the outskirts; Chipping Sodbury, similar in character; and Yate, a 1950-60s dormitory town for commuters to Bristol. The rural area supports dairy and sheep farming. There is high economic growth and low unemployment. The Lib Dems gained from the Tories in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Steve Webb"
"489","572","Tiverton & Honiton","Tiverton_and_Honiton","Substantially redrawn, the constituency is now a strip of Devonshire heartland along the border with Somerset and Dorset. From Tiverton at the north its main towns are Cullompton, Honiton \u2013 a popular cream-tea stop for holidaymakers heading west \u2013 Axminster at Devon\u2019s eastern tip and Seaton on the coast. Much of the rolling countryside inbetween is agricultural, employing nearly 7 per cent of the population. The seat is less affluent but less ageing than most of the county. It has returned Tory MPs for decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Angela Browning"
"490","575","Torbay","Torbay","The densely populated constituency takes in much of the \u201cEnglish Riviera\u201d borough of Torbay. It includes the sandy beaches of Paignton and palm-lined promenades of Torquay, which is still trying to shrug off the Basil Fawlty image that has dogged hoteliers since John Cleese&apos;s television comedy series Fawlty Towers was filmed there in the 1970s. These resorts, and villages such as Cockington, attract hordes of tourists and retired people. It was staunchly Conservative until 1997, when the Lib Dems took it by 12 votes.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Adrian Sanders"
"491","577","Totnes","Totnes","Totnes hosts a colony of eco-friendly New Agers who are more likely to offer visitors a cup of chai than PG Tips. The constituency extends north-west to the fringes of Dartmoor and south to the coastal town of Salcombe, taking in a chunk of South Hams with its sheltered countryside and pretty beaches. Other towns include Dartmouth and the Torbay fishing port of Brixham. Tourism drives the economy though farming and fishing remain. The seat has returned Tory MPs for decades but Lib Dems have recently reduced the majorities.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Anthony Steen"
"492","579","Truro & Falmouth","Truro_and_Falmouth","The cathedral city of Truro is the centre of Cornwall\u2019s trade and commerce and geographic heart of this constituency, which has lost St Austell but gained Falmouth. On the eastern side is St Mawes peninsula, whose secluded beaches draw tourists. There are relatively high numbers of working class and self-employed. Despite the recession, Truro remained one of Britain\u2019s most desirable places to live, with house prices several per cent higher than elsewhere in Cornwall. The predecessor seat had been Liberal or Lib Dem since 1974.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Matthew Taylor"
"493","609","Wells","Wells","England\u2019s smallest city gives its name to this North Somerset seat. Wells Cathedral\u2019s magnificent 14th century clock shows the Sun and Moon revolving round Earth and it sometimes feels as if time has stood still here since the days of that dogma. The Mendip Hills and Cheddar Gorge to the north, wetlands of Somerset Levels to the west and Glastonbury at the south are big tourist draws. To the east is Shepton Mallet and to the west the resort of Burnham-on-Sea. Conservatives have held since 1945 but in 1997 by 528 votes.","The current Tory MP for this seat is David Heathcoat-Amory"
"494","617","Weston-super-Mare","Weston-super-Mare","Weston-super-Mare was once the queen of bucket-and-spade resorts, catering to workers from the Midlands. The tide of tourism has turned, leaving behind retired people and social security claimants, and the town has pockets of severe deprivation. However, the wider North Somerset constituency is generally prosperous, stretching east beyond the M5 to rural areas toward the Mendip Hills, and has a growing commuter population. The seat was Tory for 74 years, Lib Dems took it in 1997 and Conservatives regained it in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Penrose"
"495","619","Wiltshire North","North_Wiltshire","The old North Wiltshire seat has been cut by nearly 18,000 electors and loses Chippenham (which gets its own seat) to gain the smaller town of Calne. It is a predominantly rural area, dotted with limestone villages. Wootton Bassett has become the focus of national mourning for soldiers killed in Afghanistan, whose bodies are  repatriated via RAF Lyneham \u2013 due to close in 2012. To the north of the M4, which bisects the constituency, lie Malmesbury and Cricklade, small market towns. The seat has been Tory since 1924.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is James Gray"
"496","620","Wiltshire South West","South_West_Wiltshire","This large, rural seat was shifted south to make way for the Chippenham seat. In the old county town of Trowbridge, technology enterprises have replaced old wool industries. Twinned with Oujda in Morocco, it has one of the largest Moroccan populations outside North Africa. Warminster, home of the Army\u2019s Land Warfare Centre and Headquarters Infantry, borders Salisbury Plain. In the south, small towns, villages and farms are dotted about in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The seat has been Tory since the 1920s.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew Murrison"
"497","646","Yeovil","Yeovil","Yeovil, at the extreme east, is by far the biggest town and is famous for its aerospace industries: AgustaWestland, the helicopter manufacturer, employs 4,000 people. After boundary changes the seat includes the Royal Naval Air Station at Yeovilton, at the northern tip, also a notable employer. Chard, the second biggest town, lies to the west, surrounded by a particularly sparsely-populated rural area of hamlets and isolated houses. The seat\u2019s Liberal tradition began with the election of Paddy Ashdown in 1983.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Laws"
"498","1","Aberavon","Aberavon","This South Wales seat encompasses a stretch of industrial coastline around Port Talbot. A controversial new power station lies by the mouth of the River Neath and Aberavon Sands, while the Corus steel works is close to the Margam Sands. This is a working-class seat in which about a fifth of residents live in social housing and about 25 per cent work in manufacturing. Reaching inland, it includes Baglan, Cwmafan and Glyncorrwg. Once Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s seat, it has been solidly Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Hywel Francis"
"499","2","Aberconwy","Aberconwy","This large North Wales seat reaches from Llandudno and Conwy on the coast at the north, inland to Llanrwst, Betws-y-Coed and beyond. Based on the old Conwy seat, it no longer includes Bangor, instead extending farther south. Much of the west of the seat lies within the Snowdonia National Park and tourism is a major employer. There are high numbers of Welsh speakers here. The old seat was once safely Tory until Labour took it in 1997 and boundary changes reduced Labour\u2019s majority.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Betty Williams"
"500","10","Alyn & Deeside","Alyn_and_Deeside","This seat borders with Chester in England. Queensferry, Connah\u2019s Quay and Buckley dominate the north, with industrial works along the River Dee. The south, around Caergwrle, is more rural while Broughton at the east is home to a BAE Systems factory that builds wings for Airbus planes. The constituency\u2019s demographic is fairly evenly split across the middle and working classes, while manufacturing is a traditionally strong sector. This seat has been Labour since its 1983 inception.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Mark Tami"
"501","16","Arfon","Arfon","This new Welsh seat is bounded by the Menai Strait, dividing it from Ynys Mon. The two main towns, Bangor and Caernarfon, both lie by the water, while Bethesda is slightly inland. The eastern half of the seat is more rural, much of it within the Snowdonia National Park. Hill farming is very important to the economy. This seat has one of the highest concentrations of Welsh speakers in Wales. The old Caernarfon seat was held by Plaid Cymru since 1974 but the Bangor area from the old Conwy seat is seen as more Labour-leaning.","The current PC MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Hywel Williams"
"502","71","Blaenau Gwent","Blaenau_Gwent","This seat in the valleys includes the former steel town of Ebbw Vale, plus Tredegar, Beaufort, Brynmawr, Blaina and Abertillery. Manufacturing has traditionally been strong in this working-class seat, in which more than 25 per cent of residents live in social housing and poor health is common. The area was dependent on coalmining and is steeped in Labour history, having been held by Aneurin Bevan and Michael Foot. It was won by Peter Law, an independent, in 2005, who resigned from Labour after a row over all-women shortlists. He died in 2006 and his agent won it in the by-election.","The current Ind MP for this seat is Dai Davies"
"503","89","Brecon & Radnorshire","Brecon_and_Radnorshire","This rural South Powys seat reaches into the Black Mountains, around Crickhowell and Talgarth. Much of the south is within the Brecon Beacons National Park, by the town of Brecon. Llanwrtyd Wells, Llandrindod Wells, Builth Wells, Hay-on-Wye and Knighton are other settlements. The seat\u2019s demographic is most notable for large numbers of self-employed and small business owners, reflecting the dominance of agriculture, which employs about a tenth of the population. Before 1979 it was a safe Labour seat but since then has changed between Tory and Liberal parties, most recently being taken by the Liberal Democrats in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for this seat is Roger Williams"
"504","94","Bridgend","Bridgend","This South Wales seat is dominated by Bridgend. Like Pyle, it is next to the M4 motorway, though the seat also reaches through rural land to the coast at Porthcawl.

Only minor boundary changes have been made to the seat, which has been held by Labour since 1987.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Madeleine Moon"
"505","114","Caerphilly","Caerphilly","Lying just to the north of Cardiff, this seat\u2019s eponymous main town sits by the Rhymney River at the south, while Bargoed, Nelson and Ystrad Mynach form an urban triangle at the north. About a fifth of residents live in social housing in this formerly industrial area. There have been only minor boundary changes to this seat, which has returned Labour MPs for the best part of a century. Plaid Cymru has had strong support, but this is more likely to halt Labour than demand an independent Wales.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Wayne David"
"506","126","Cardiff Central","Cardiff_Central","Bounded by the River Taff at the southwest, this seat encompasses the heart of the Welsh capital, including the Millennium Stadium and Cardiff Castle.

"507","127","Cardiff North","Cardiff_North","This seat follows the line of the M4 motorway as it arcs around the north of Cardiff, including areas such as Whitchurch and Heath, home to the hospital. Mostly smart residential suburbs with semi-detached homes lining leafy streets, these areas are home to high numbers of professionals. Held by the Tories from its creation in 1982 until 1997, the seat switched to Labour, but by 2005 majorities were narrow.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Julie Morgan"
"508","128","Cardiff South & Penarth","Cardiff_South_and_Penarth","Stretching along the Bristol Channel from the Barry power station and Sully, this seat reaches up through Penarth and along Cardiff\u2019s seafront to suburbs such as Rumney.

The seat\u2019s mixed demographic includes many professionals, but about a fifth of residents live in social housing. The seat has a long Labour history, interrupted only by one term of Tory rule, from 1983-87.

At the west, the boundaries take in the half of Carmarthen to the east of the River Towy. The northern boundary follows the line of the River Teifi, which splits Newcastle Emlyn in two, including the southern half in the seat. The seat\u2019s economy is heavily focused on agriculture. Plaid Cymru won their first Westminster seat here in 1966, with Gwynfor Evans, and it has changed hands between the nationalists and Labour several times since.","The current PC MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Adam Price"

Inland, towns include the half of Newcastle Emlyn north of the River Teifi, and Lampeter. Agriculture dominates the economy and about 50 per cent of the population speak Welsh. Several Welsh Assembly departments have recently relocated to offices in Aberystwyth. The seat was won by Plaid Cymru in 1992, but fell to the Liberal Democrats.

"513","154","Clwyd South","Clwyd_South","The River Dee flows through this northeastern constituency, passing the main town of Llangollen in the centre. Ruabon is among other towns and the seat stretches to the border with Shropshire at the east. Both the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are bigger than average but the class demographic is unremarkable. About 25 per cent of residents live in social housing. The seat has been Labour since its creation in 1997, though recent boundary changes have removed some Labour-leaning wards.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Martin Jones"
"514","155","Clwyd West","Clwyd_West","This large North Wales seat forms an \u2018L shape\u2019, with its northern boundary reaching from Colwyn Bay, through Abergele to Kinmel Bay. The seaside is popular with pensioners. From here the seat reaches south to Clocaenog Forest, then east past Ruthin to the Clwydian mountain range. The agricultural sector is above average, but the health sector is notable. Labour won this seat from the Tories under new boundaries in 1997, only to lose it back to them in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Jones"
"515","174","Cynon Valley","Cynon_Valley","A chain of towns line the banks of the River Cynon, which runs the length of the seat. These include Abercynon, Mountain Ash and Aberdare. Only at the north does it give way to open expanses of rural land. This is a working-class seat, with an economy focused on manufacturing in the place of the old heavy industries. Health is poor in the area. This seat has a long history of returning Labour MPs.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ann Clwyd"
"516","179","Delyn","Delyn","This Flintshire seat is across the Dee Estuary from the Wirral. Its main towns include Holywell and Mold and its economy has traditionally focused on manufacturing.

The main coastal towns are Pwllheli, Criccieth, Porthmadog, Barmouth and Tywyn. The seat covers some of Snowdonia National Park. Inland are Dolgellau and Blaenau Ffestiniog.

The affluent Mumbles and Port-Eynon are the main towns on its southern coast. Apart from the Peninsula the seat encompasses an area of the Lliw Valley inland to the northeast, including Gorseinon, Clydach and Pontarddulais. A comfortably well-off seat, it is home to celebrities such as Catherine Zeta-Jones and Bonnie Tyler. The service sector is the main source of employment, but industry was traditionally the lynchpin of the economy, helping explain Labour\u2019s dominance historically.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Martin Caton"

"520","375","Llanelli","Llanelli","This South Wales seat reaches from Kidwelly and Pembrey Forest, around to the north side of the Loughor Estuary, taking in Burry Port and Llanelli. Once focused on coal and steel industries, Llanelli now has a more diverse manufacturing base but remains working class, with a large population living in social housing and severe deprivation around seafront. The coast is home to many pensioners.

The area has been Labour since the time of Keir Hardie.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Dai Havard"

Usk and Abergavenny are other towns on the River Usk popular with game fishermen. Picturesque and rural, this is also one of the more Anglicised areas, with relatively few Welsh speakers. With large numbers of middle-class residents, this was once a safe Tory area.

"524","408","Neath","Neath","The eponymous town lies at the south of this seat, with small villages dotted along the Vale of Neath. Farther north, the Swansea Valley has another cluster of settlements, including Ystalyfera, while at the northern tip lies Graun-Cae-Gurwen. Once industrial, the seat remains working class with a focus on manufacturing, although EU funding and regeneration projects have helped diversify the economy and the health sector is also notably strong. The seat has been held by Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Peter Hain"
"525","417","Newport East","Newport_East","At the southeast corner of Wales, this seat spans along the River Severn, from Caldicot, by the second Severn crossing, to the River Usk, which divides Newport in two. The eastern half of the town included in this seat is home to many of Newport\u2019s famous prefab houses, which are being replaced. The M4 motorway runs near the north of the seat. The Llanwern steelworks was a major employer but has been closed down or mothballed. The seat remains working class and has historically been represented by Labour.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Jessica Morden"
"526","418","Newport West","Newport_West","On the northern banks of the Severn and the western banks of the River Usk, this seat includes much of the town centre. A museum part focused on the uprising of the Newport Chartists in 1839 is here. It also includes suburbs such as Rogerstone, beyond the M4. It curves round the town and crosses the Usk to include the Celtic Manor Resort, the 2010 host of golf\u2019s Ryder Cup. This seat is more middle class than its eastern neighbour and the service sector is important. It returned a Tory on its creation in 1983 but Labour MPs thereafter.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Paul Flynn"
"527","437","Ogmore","Ogmore","The towns of Pencoed and Pontyclun lie near the seat\u2019s southern border, which roughly follows the route of the M4 motorway. Farther north, Maesteg is the main town. The seat takes its name from Ogmore Forest. Former mining communities such as Blaengarw have suffered deprivation and the area was in the media spotlight after several youth suicides in recent years. This is an overwhelmingly working-class seat in which manufacturing still dominates. It has been Labour since 1918.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Huw Irranca-Davies"
"528","454","Pontypridd","Pontypridd","To the northwest of Cardiff, this seat has numerous small towns lining the A-roads that criss-cross it. These include Llantrisant, Pontyclun and Beddau at the south, and Church Village and Ponrypridd in Taff Vale at the northeast. These areas were once mining towns and the seat retains a manufacturing presence. It is home to a large middle-class population, a strong service sector and a popular university, which attracts adult learners. The seat has been reduced under boundary changes but the remaining area has a strong Labour tradition.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Dr Kim Howells"
"529","459","Preseli Pembrokeshire","Preseli_Pembrokeshire","This large rural seat boasts a stunning coastline, encompassing the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park around St Brides Bay and into Cardigan Bay. The western half of the seat is particularly Anglicised and the influx of people with second homes from South Wales and England to towns such as St David\u2019s, Goodwick and Fishguard has led to this area being dubbed the \u201cNew North Cornwall\u201d. Milford Haven is the site of large oil refineries. Inland, the main town is Haverfordwest. The seat returned Labour MPs for two terms after its creation in 1997, but it was narrowly won by the Tories in 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Stephen Crabb"
"530","470","Rhondda","Rhondda","The Rhondda Valley in South Wales encompasses two river valleys. Towns such as Tonypandy, Treorchy and Treherbert line Rhondda Fawr (\u201clarge\u201d) at the west, while smaller settlements such as Tylorstown and Ferndale follow Rhondda Fach (\u201csmall\u201d) at the east. Porth lies where the two converge at the south. A working-class seat with strong manufacturing sector, many of the old mining communities suffer from poor health. The seat has been held by Labour since 1910.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Chris Bryant"
"531","558","Swansea East","Swansea_East","This seat includes the Swansea Docks on the River Severn and crosses the River Tawe to stretch northwest as far as Port Mead and Penderry. There are areas of severe deprivation here and at the south. The seat encompasses the Swansea Enterprise Park, which has offices and out-of-town retailers that create the mainstay of the formerly industrial economy. More than a fifth of residents live in social housing and there is a large working class. The M4 passes through the north of the seat. Labour has represented here since 1922.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Sian James"
"532","559","Swansea West","Swansea_West","This seat includes the centre of Swansea, its university and marina, as well as industrial estates, works and a chocolate factory. There is deprivation at the east, especially in Townhill and Castle wards; the west is more affluent. There are large numbers of students and also high numbers of the middle classes, with the health and education sectors dominating the economy. More than fifth of residents live in social housing. The seat was briefly held by the Tories prior to Alan Williams winning it for Labour in 1964.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Alan Williams"
"533","576","Torfaen","Torfaen","This southeast seat has a number of towns along the River Lwyd. These include Cwmbran at the south, Pontypool, Abertillery and Blaenavon \u2013 which grew around the iron works and subsequent steel and coal industries and is preserved as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Still a working class, manufacturing-oriented seat, about 25 per cent of its residents live in social housing. Roy Jenkins, who was Home Secretary, hailed from Abersychan but never represented the seat, which has been Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Paul Murphy"
"534","588","Vale of Clwyd","Vale_of_Clwyd","This spans from the coast, at Rhyl and Prestatyn, inland to Denbigh and beyond. Rhyl includes some of the most deprived areas in Wales, with a high claimant rate and social problems, but the town is undergoing regeneration. It was also where John Prescott punched a countryside protestor who had thrown an egg at him in 2001. A varied seat, it has a slight working-class demographic skew but the middle classes are also well represented. Health is the biggest economic sector. Labour won this seat on its creation in 1997 but the Tories had previously been strong in predecessor constituencies.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Chris Ruane"
"535","589","Vale of Glamorgan","Vale_of_Glamorgan","This South Wales seat spans from Ogmore-by-Sea to Barry, which has come to prominence as the setting for the television show Gavin and Stacey. Other coastal towns include St Athan and Llantwit Major, while inland lies Cowbridge. The coast is home to the \u201cCrachach\u201d \u2013 the elite of Welsh life. This predominantly middle-class seat was once regarded as safe for the Tories. However, Labour won it in a 1989 by-election, lost it in 1992, but regained in 1997 and held on with reduced majorities in 2001 and 2005.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Smith"
"536","641","Wrexham","Wrexham","The eponymous town lies southwest of this seat, which fans out north including the town of Gresford, and east to the River Dee, which forms the border with England. Once a market town in a coalmining area, Wrexham\u2019s economy has diversified successfully and it is home to a huge industrial estate. About 25 per cent of residents live in social housing. However, the seat also has a sizeable middle-class population and although it has been Labour for decades, its MPs have not always enjoyed great majorities.

Towns include Menai Bridge, Llangefni, Amlwch and Holyhead. The seat includes a nuclear power plant, RAF bases and Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. It is home to one of the largest concentrations of Welsh speakers in the country. The Tories overturned decades of Labour representation in 1979 and held on for two terms, before Plaid Cymru won in 1987. Labour took it in 2001 and held on in 2005 but their majorities over PC were narrow.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Albert Owen"
"538","8","Aldridge-Brownhills","Aldridge-Brownhills","Named after its two towns, this Walsall seat lies at the northeast of the West Midlands conurbation, on the border with Staffordshire. Aldridge, at the south, is very affluent and often referred to as a village. Brownhills, farther out, is a former mining community; manufacturing has had an important place in this seat and there are high numbers of working classes. The eastern Walsall suburbs of Pelsall and Rushall are also included. The seat has been Conservative since 1979.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Richard Shepherd"
"539","57","Birmingham Edgbaston","Birmingham__Edgbaston","Just southwest of the city centre, Edgbaston contains a significant spill-over business district around Five Ways and Hagley Road, as well as Birmingham University. Stretching out to Bartley Green, on the border with rural Worcestershire, the rest of the seat is primarily residential. It encompasses Harborne, popular with young professionals. The seat becomes less affluent farther away from the centre. The economy is overwhelmingly service sector, and about a fifth of residents are black or ethnic minority. The Conservatives held the seat from 1885 until Labour\u2019s victory in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Gisela Stuart"
"540","58","Birmingham Erdington","Birmingham__Erdington","This largely residential seat is bounded by the M6 to the southeast, dividing it from Birmingham city centre. It has significant areas of deprivation, especially in Kingstanding and Tyburn, although the Castle Vale estate in Tyburn improved with the replacement of tower blocks in the 1990s. Unemployment is high and the economy is more dependent on manufacturing than elsewhere. Tyburn is home to the Jaguar car assembly plant, where jobs have looked insecure, and the old Fort Dunlop complex, which has been turned into retail and office space. The seat has been Labour since its creation in 1974.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Sion Simon"
"541","59","Birmingham Hall Green","Birmingham__Hall_Green","This southern seat has been substantially redrawn, changing its character, as well as boosting its size by about 16,000 electors. The affluent Hall Green, on the outskirts, remains but other outlying areas have been replaced by more deprived inner-city wards from the old Sparkbrook and Small Heath seat. Moseley is a mix of bohemian, artsy middle classes and traditional professionals. More than half of the seat\u2019s residents are black or ethnic minorities. Under the old boundaries, the seat was Conservative for 47 years before Labour\u2019s 1997 victory.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Roger Godsiff"
"542","60","Birmingham Hodge Hill","Birmingham__Hodge_Hill","To the east of Birmingham city centre, this residential seat has increased by about 20,000 electors, gaining areas formerly in the old Sparkbrook and Small Heath seat. Hodge Hill is comfortably well off but otherwise this is a poor, densely populated seat, which, despite regeneration attempts, has high levels of deprivation, especially in Washwood Heath. The seat is predominantly an Asian area, but was once white and working class. It is home to Birmingham City FC, whose fans painted the Sleeping Iron Giant sculpture to match their \u201cbluenose\u201d nickname. The seat has been Labour since 1950.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Liam Byrne"
"543","61","Birmingham Ladywood","Birmingham__Ladywood","Birmingham city centre lies in this seat, with the main business district in Ladywood ward. The economy is overwhelmingly service sector and about a third of the workforce is in the financial or business sector. Those living in sought-after residential properties in the centre are affluent but the seat is only averagely well off, with large areas of deprivation beyond the centre. About 44 per cent of residents are aged 24 and under, the most youthful demographic of all Birmingham seats, while about two thirds are black or ethnic minorities, predominantly Asian. This Labour-dominated seat had an independent MP after Clare Short had the whip withdrawn in 2006.","The current Independent MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Clare Short, who resigned the Labour whip in 2006"
"544","62","Birmingham Northfield","Birmingham__Northfield","At the southwestern tip of Birmingham, this seat borders with semi-rural Bromsgrove areas. Substantially increased by about 17,000 electors after gaining Kings Norton from the Selly Oak ward, it remains primarily residential and significantly less ethnically diverse than most of Birmingham. Although generally better off than many Birmingham seats, it was hit hard by the 2005 closure of the Longbridge Rover plant, which had dominated the economy. The seat changed hands several times between 1979 and 1992, when Labour won.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Richard Burden"
"545","63","Birmingham Perry Barr","Birmingham__Perry_Barr","This northwest Birmingham constituency is primarily residential and contains some relatively affluent, leafy suburbs. However, the Lozells and East Handsworth ward, nearest the city centre, is extremely deprived and has experienced racial tensions between black and Asian communities who together comprise more than 80 per cent of the ward\u2019s (and more than half of the seat\u2019s) residents. The manufacturing sector is stronger than in any other Birmingham seat, although many work in public services. Labour has held since 1974 with varying majorities.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Khalid Mahmood"
"546","64","Birmingham Selly Oak","Birmingham__Selly_Oak","This south Birmingham seat has been substantially redrawn, losing Kings Norton and Moseley and Kings Heath wards but gaining Billesley and Brandwood, on the outskirts of the city. These new areas are less affluent than Bournville \u2013 a model village built in 1893 by George Cadbury \u2013 and Selly Oak, which is home to large numbers of students. The seat is less ethnically diverse than much of the city. Under old boundaries it changed hands several times, won by Labour in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Lynne Jones"
"547","65","Birmingham Yardley","Birmingham__Yardley","At the southeast of the city the Yardley seat has been increased by about 21,000 electors. Manufacturing and construction are above the city average although the service sector still dominates. Attempts to develop areas of Stechford with new apartments failed to take off. All four wards have a mixture of deprived and fairly affluent areas. Traditionally a Conservative-Labour marginal seat, the Liberal Democrats took it in 2005.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Hemming"
"548","105","Bromsgrove","Bromsgrove","Although not far from the main West Midlands conurbation, this northeast Worcestershire seat is separated by the Lickey Hills Country Park and is more rural; 90 per cent is greenbelt land. The main urban areas are around Bromsgrove and in the northeastern corner closest to Birmingham, with large villages such as Alvechurch and Wythall. Generally affluent, it is popular with commuters. The seat has traditionally been Conservative.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Julie Kirkbride"
"549","110","Burton","Burton","Forming a long, thin arc along the border with Derbyshire, this east Staffordshire seat is named after Burton-upon-Trent, at its southeastern corner, famed for its Abbey and brewing. The town is primarily working class and has areas of severe deprivation. As the seat stretches north through rural land to Uttoxeter and beyond, it becomes more rural and more affluent. Labour overturned 23 years of Tory rule when they took the seat in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Janet Dean"
"550","124","Cannock Chase","Cannock_Chase","Just north of the West Midlands conurbation, the Staffordshire town of Cannock lies at the foot of this seat, with the urban area merging into nearby Hednesford. They are divided from Rugeley at the north by Cannock Chase, a large Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty with lowland heath and woodland and home to wild deer. Typically for the area, construction and manufacturing are strong sectors and, although this seat remains working class, its economy is buoyant and it avoids extremes of deprivation. Under old boundaries it was taken by Labour in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tony Wright"
"551","165","Coventry North East","Coventry_North_East","East of Coventry city centre, this working-class seat spans out to the M6 motorway. Traditionally focused on manufacturing, these industries have suffered job losses, gradually being replaced with service sector employment. Large areas of deprivation blight the seat.

"552","166","Coventry North West","Coventry_North_West","From severely deprived inner-city areas just beyond Coventry\u2019s commercial centre, this seat fans out to affluent semi-rural areas at the northwest, home to relatively high numbers of professionals. However, Coventry\u2019s traditional working-class vote, built around the car manufacturing industry that dominated for decades, has tended to triumph, with Labour dominant since the Second World War.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Geoffrey Robinson"
"553","167","Coventry South","Coventry_South","Coventry city centre lies at the north of this seat, with its cathedral, expanses of concrete offices and the university, which leads to a significant student vote in the seat. The residential tower blocks in St Michael\u2019s ward lie amid one of the most deprived areas in the country but south of the city centre it is more mixed, with the more middle-class areas of Earlsdon and Wainbody and large numbers of professionals. The seat was won by Labour on its creation in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jim Cunningham"
"554","204","Dudley North","Dudley_North","To the west of Birmingham, Dudley is known as the capital of the Black Country and this seat includes the town centre, with its famous castle. Areas of severe deprivation exist, while farther out, towards the Staffordshire border, the small town of Segdley is more affluent. Suburban residential areas lie between the two town centres. Once reliant on collieries, the economy still has a manufacturing focus and the seat is strongly working class, with over a quarter living in council housing. Labour since 1994, the BNP has had some success.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ian Austin"
"555","205","Dudley South","Dudley_South","The southern half of this West Midlands town contains more industrial areas, especially in Brierley Hill near the canal at the east of the seat, and in the large Pensnett trading estate. White, working classes traditionally employed in manufacturing are typical residents in these severely deprived areas, which contrast with the more affluent Kingswinford area at the west, dominated by residential suburbs. Labour won this seat in a 1994 by-election.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ian Pearson"
"556","282","Halesowen & Rowley Regis","Halesowen_and_Rowley_Regis","This West Midlands seat, to the south of Dudley, is bordered by the M5 to the east. There is a significant number of affluent middle classes around Halesowen and residential housing typifies the south of the seat, while at the very south is an area of farmland on the border with rural Worcestershire. Farther north, Blackheath and Rowley Regis are more industrial and working class areas, which helped Labour to win in 1997.

"557","306","Hereford & Herefordshire South","Hereford_and_South_Herefordshire","From the county town of Hereford, the seat fans out to Ross-on-Wye at the southeast and the border with Wales at the west. Agriculture accounts for an important economic sector, with a weekly livestock market in Hereford, as does tourism, with a Norman cathedral and pretty countryside. After decades of Tory dominance it was won by the Liberal Democrats in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Paul Keetch"
"558","307","Herefordshire North","North_Herefordshire","This seat has lost territory from Worcestershire and gained Old Gore at the south. Its renaming reflects the huge rural area surrounding Leominster town, including other market towns of Kington, Bromyard and Ledbury. Cattle and sheep farming remains important in this seat, which has one of the highest proportions of residents employed in the agricultural sector in the country. It has been Conservative since 1906.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Bill Wiggin"
"559","339","Kenilworth & Southam","Kenilworth_and_Southam","This new seat consists of a large rural area centred on Southam in the east, and a branch out to the west between Coventry and Warwick, including the main historic town of Kenilworth with its ruined castle. The M40 runs through the seat making for affluent commuter. The area has traditionally been Conservative but, under previous boundaries, Kenilworth was twinned with Rugby and had a Labour MP between 1997 and 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jeremy Wright"
"560","367","Lichfield","Lichfield","The population of this West Midlands seat is concentrated at its south, in the cathedral city of Lichfield and large town of Burntwood. It becomes more rural as it stretches farther north away from the Birmingham conurbation, into areas in the national forest. Typical of the area, manufacturing is an important sector and this is an economically active seat, with high numbers of professionals. The seat has been Conservative in recent years, but the margin of victory in 1997 was just 238 votes after a recount.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Michael Fabricant"
"561","379","Ludlow","Ludlow","This vast rural constituency spans southern Shropshire, from the border with Wales in the west with Staffordshire in the east. This is one of the most agricultural in England and earnings are below national and county averages, with many living in isolated rural areas. More affluent areas lie near the amenities of the towns of Bridgnorth, Church Stretton and Ludlow - a renowned \u201cfoodie\u201d destination with an annual festival and two Michelin-starred restaurants. The Liberal Democrats broke more than a century of Tory dominance in 2001 but the seat was won back by the Conservatives in 2005.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Philip Dunne"
"562","392","Meriden","Meriden","The bulk of this oddly shaped seat is rural, occupying the area between Solihull and Coventry and scattered with affluent commuter towns such as Dorridge, Balsall Common and Meriden, the geographical centre of the country. A branch snakes up to the east of Birmingham, including the International airport and the National Exhibition Centre. Beyond these lies a residential concentration, with deprived areas such as Kingshurst and Chelmsley Wood where there is tension between white working classes and Asians. The area has been earmarked for regeneration funds. The seat was a Labour-Tory marginal before the Conservative victory of 1979.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Caroline Spelman"
"563","413","Newcastle-under-Lyme","Newcastle-under-Lyme","The Staffordshire town of Newcastle-under-Lyme lies at the bottom of this seat, with its suburbs sprawling north and barely separated by A-roads and a brook from neighbouring Stoke-on-Trent. Towards the northern border with Cheshire lies the town of Audley amid semi-rural land. The M6 runs through this seat, with Keele University nearby. With potteries and coalmining history this is traditionally working class and Labour-leaning, although better off than Stoke.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Paul Farrelly"
"564","435","Nuneaton","Nuneaton","In Warwickshire, just north of Coventry, Nuneaton is within easy reach of the West Midlands conurbation and is increasingly popular with commuting professionals. However, it grew around industries and there remains a strong working class and areas of deprivation. This substantially redrawn seat has gained a small semi-rural area west of Hartshill at the north, for the loss of a much larger and more affluent expanse from its south. Under old boundaries the Tories held it from 1983-1992 before Labour won it back.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Bill Olner"
"565","467","Redditch","Redditch","This Worcestershire seat lies 15 miles south of the West Midlands conurbation. The population is concentrated in Redditch, at the northeast of the seat, which was designated a new town in 1964 to accommodate overspill from Birmingham. There are areas of deprivation around the town centre, but the boundaries encompass a more affluent rural area in the south. The large Inkberrow ward has been slightly extended under boundary changes. The seat was won on its creation in 1997 by Jacqui Smith, whose two-year stint as Home Secretary ended in 2009 after she became embroiled in the expenses scandal.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jacqui Smith"
"566","483","Rugby","Rugby","After substantial boundary changes, Rugby was split from the Kenilworth area and given its own seat, stretching north from the town through Fosse, Wolvey and Bulkington, to the edge of Nuneaton. This affluent rural area and southern Rugby, which tend to be Conservative-voting, contrasts with the less affluent and more Labour-leaning industrial north of the town, where there are patches of deprivation. The seat is home to Rugby School where the game of rugby football was invented in 1823.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"567","510","Shrewsbury & Atcham","Shrewsbury_and_Atcham","The town of Shrewsbury, with its historic English and Welsh Bridges, lies at the centre of this seat, surrounded by Shropshire countryside. There are affluent areas to the west of the town centre and in the rural areas within easy commuting distance. However, more deprived areas home to disaffected youth are found to the east and in the isolated outlying countryside. The service sector dominates the economy. Once a safe Tory seat, it was taken by Labour in 1997 only for Paul Marsden to defect to the Lib Dems after the 2001 election. The Conservatives regained it in 2005.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Daniel Kawczynski"

The other main towns are Whitchurch, Wem and Ellesmere, site of Ellesmere College. Agriculture is a defining feature of politics and the economy here, with earnings below county and national averages and farmers defensive of their interests. The idyllic landscape also attracts tourists. The Tories have represented this seat for decades, usually with safe majorities.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Owen Paterson"
"569","516","Solihull","Solihull","At the southeast of Birmingham, this is generally a very affluent seat with residential concentrations around Solihull and Shirley. The National Exhibition Centre and Birmingham International Airport lie just beyond the seat\u2019s northwestern boundary and bring business tourism to the area, but the decline of traditional manufacturing has been seen, particularly with job losses from the seat\u2019s Land Rover plant. Traditionally staunchly Conservative, it was a surprise win for the Lib Dems in 2005.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Lorely Burt"

The main town of Stafford and the smaller Penkridge to the south run alongside the motorway, while the seat also includes substantial rural land reaching to the border with Shropshire.

Substantial boundary changes resulting in a net loss of electors saw the loss of  the mining town Kidsgrove but the gain of the Brown Edge and Endon areas in the east of Stoke-on-Trent, and Alton, home to the Alton Towers theme park.

Hopes are set on the regeneration of the former site. Tunstall has similarly suffered from the closure of ceramics firms. Boundary changes have removed territory from the east of the seat, but it has gained the former mining town of Kidsgrove at the north.

"575","539","Stoke-on-Trent South","Stoke-on-Trent_South","Longton and Fenton are two of the six original Staffordshire pottery towns, although Fenton was famously forgotten in Arnold Bennett\u2019s novels. Unemployment from the decline of the ceramics industries has been high in recent years and there are large areas of deprivation in this working-class seat, with many in non-skilled occupations. About a fifth live in council housing, although there are some more affluent areas at the southwest.

The M6 runs through the seat and its good connections make it popular with affluent professionals. It has been held by the Conservatives since its creation in 1997.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is William Cash"
"577","541","Stourbridge","Stourbridge","At the southwestern corner of the West Midlands conurbation, this seat borders on Staffordshire and Worcestershire and includes some very affluent semi-rural areas at its outskirts. The commercial centre of Stourbridge and Lye, a deprived industrial town, lies to the south of the river Stour, while Quarry Bank is a residential area to its north. It is a mixed seat, with both middle-class professionals and working classes well represented. It has changed hands many times, with Labour winning in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Lynda Waltho"
"578","543","Stratford-on-Avon","Stratford-on-Avon","An historic market town synonymous with Shakespeare, Stratford-upon-Avon sits in the middle of this seat, with rural land extending to its northwest and southeast. The seat has, however, been cut back, losing a vast area that used to extend up to Southam at its northeast. Tourism is a major sector and the seat is home to large numbers of well-off professionals, many commuting north to Birmingham. Traditionally Conservative, it had a Labour MP for two years when Alan Howarth defected to Labour in 1995.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John  Maples"
"579","557","Sutton Coldfield","Sutton_Coldfield","Physically the largest of the Birmingham seats, Sutton Coldfield lies at the north of the city and is a town in its own right, distinct in character and prosperity. It includes rural areas on the outskirts as well as Sutton Park. The town centre, in Trinity ward, has a concentration of businesses but it is otherwise largely residential. This is a very affluent seat home to overwhelmingly white middle classes.  It has been Conservative since its creation in 1945.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Andrew Mitchell"
"580","562","Tamworth","Tamworth","This Staffordshire seat lies just north of the Birmingham conurbation. The population is heavily concentrated in Tamworth, although the seat includes semi-rural areas to its north and west. Manufacturing and distribution are important sectors, with the M6 toll road running through the west of the seat. A very economically active seat, professionals are well represented, as well as traditional working classes. Under old boundaries, Labour took the seat from the Conservatives in a 1996 by-election.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Brian Jenkins"
"581","565","Telford","Telford","About 30 miles west of Birmingham, the roundabouts and charmless but convenient modern centre of Telford testify to its status as a post-war new town, although the original towns in its urban sprawl retain a sense of identity. It grew dramatically, only to suffer from economic decline and high unemployment in the early 1990s. A large number of people are employed in manufacturing, especially in the electronics and polymers sectors, but there is also a growing service sector and EDS is a major employer. The seat was won by Labour on its creation in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Wright"
"582","593","Walsall North","Walsall_North","Once the \u201cleather capital of the world\u201d Walsall has long been dependent on traditional manufacturing industries, which have been in decline for decades. The seat has areas of severe deprivation, especially to the east, and its residents are working class, along with high numbers who have never worked. About a third live in council housing. This is a predominantly white seat with a small Asian community. The exception in Labour\u2019s post-1950 dominance was a three-year Conservative stint after the John Stonehouse scandal triggered a by-election in 1976.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Winnick"
"583","594","Walsall South","Walsall_South","Walsall town centre lies in this seat. There is severe deprivation here and in Darlaston, bisected by the M6, in the west. Both are the scene of major regeneration projects aimed at reversing decades of economic decline. This part of the seat is strongly working class with high numbers of those who have never worked and tend to vote Labour. Moving east through semi-rural areas towards Aldridge, it becomes much more affluent and Tory-leaning. Around a fifth of residents are Asian.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Bruce George"
"584","598","Warley","Warley","This seat lies about three miles from Birmingham, at the southeast corner of the Black Country. Very deprived areas around the Victorian terraces of Smethwick in the east give way to the slightly better off, semi-detached 1930s housing of Warley in the west. About a fifth of residents are ethnic minority, the biggest community being of Indian origin. This remains an overwhelmingly working-class seat with high unemployment, large numbers of residents who have never worked and council housing. It has been Labour since 1966.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Spellar"
"585","601","Warwick & Leamington","Warwick_and_Leamington","Historic Warwick, with its medieval castle, sits on the west bank of the River Avon, with Royal Leamington Spa on the east bank. Leamington was once a centre for car manufacture and is the less well off of the two towns, although its economy has increasingly diversified, including into the computer game industry. The seat is generally affluent, with good transport links as the M40 cuts through the rural area to the south of the towns. The seat has been significantly cut back, losing about 16,000 electors. Labour overturned decades of Tory dominance when they won here in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is James  Plaskitt"
"586","602","Warwickshire North","North_Warwickshire","On the eastern border of Birmingham, this C-shaped seat curves around Nuneaton constituency, under boundary changes that lost a rural chunk from its centre. The main towns are Bedworth, Polesworth, Atherstone and Coleshill \u2013 which lies by the junction of the M42 and M6 toll roads at the west and is more affluent. There are patches of deprivation in the urban areas at the east and this seat, once dominated by mining, retains a strong working class. Labour won it from the Conservatives in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mike O'Brien"
"587","612","West Bromwich East","West_Bromwich_East","The affluent northeast of this seat, around the junction of the M5 and M6, contrasts with the deprived southwest around West Bromwich town centre. At the east of the seat is a large recreational area at Sandwell Valley Country Park. The majority of residents are working class, with many living in council housing. There is a significant population of Indian origin. This seat has been Labour for decades.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Tom Watson"
"588","613","West Bromwich West","West_Bromwich_West","Good transport connections make the Sandwell area popular for industry and it is home to multinationals like Rhodia. Bordering on Walsall at the north lies Wednesbury, once a prosperous coalmining centre but now a large residential area. The seat includes some deprived areas with large housing estates such as Tibbington and Friar Park. Traditionally Labour, Betty Boothroyd was its MP for eight years.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Adrian Bailey"
"589","630","Wolverhampton North East","Wolverhampton_North_East","Reaching from Wolverhampton city centre ring road out to the border with Staffordshire, this Black Country seat includes a large and severely deprived industrial area built around the convergence of rail, road and canals. Beyond this are residential suburbs typified by the early 20th-century housing in the Fallings Park estate. Traditionally a Labour seat, the Conservatives held it  briefly from 1987-1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ken Purchase"
"590","631","Wolverhampton South East","Wolverhampton_South_East","From just south of Wolverhampton centre, this seat stretches to Bilston, with its large industrial developments. Sitting at the core of the Black Country, this is former colliery land, some of which remains disused while much has been replaced with housing. Areas of severe deprivation remain and job losses from manufacturing have worsened the situation. Unlike the other Wolverhampton seats, its predecessor remained Labour throughout the 1980s. The seat also includes the Coseley East ward from Dudley Borough.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Pat McFadden"
"591","632","Wolverhampton South West","Wolverhampton_South_West","Wolverhampton city centre, with its university, museums and commercial heart, lies on higher ground looking out over the rest of this seat to its west, which stretches to Tettenhall. Hospitals and the Wanderers\u2019 football stadium. A racecourse and golf courses lie amid middle class, residential suburban neighbourhoods typified by semi-detached properties. Enoch Powell held this seat from 1950-74 and was Conservative until 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Rob Marris"
"592","633","Worcester","Worcester","The cathedral city and county town of Worcestershire is built around the River Severn and flanked by the M5 to its east, taking commuters up to Birmingham. Worcester is very economically active, predominantly in the service sector, but with car and aerospace engineering industries surviving from its traditional manufacturing basis. There are patches of severe deprivation in the centre of the seat but farther out is affluent. Although historically a safe Tory seat, albeit under different boundaries, Labour took this seat in 1997.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Michael Foster"
"593","634","Worcestershire Mid","Mid_Worcestershire","This lengthy rural seat borders with Kidderminster at the north and skirts round the east of Worcester, stretching south to the border with Gloucestershire. The two main towns are Droitwich Spa and Evesham. Well connected to the West Midlands conurbation, it is economically active and popular with affluent professionals. Working classes are also well represented, with some light industry in the towns and agricultural work. The area has been a Tory stronghold for decades.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Peter Luff"
"594","635","Worcestershire West","West_Worcestershire","This large, rural seat encompasses the Malvern Hills district, as well as an area from Wychavon at its southwest. The spa town of Great Malvern and the smaller towns of Tenbury Wells and Upton-upon-Severn are the main population centres but several villages are strewn across the district. Agriculture influences the seat but its population is overwhelmingly affluent professionals. Both this and its predecessor seats have traditionally been Conservative.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Michael Spicer"
"595","640","Wrekin, The","The_Wrekin","Surrounding Telford on three sides, this West Midlands seat includes the towns of Wellington, Hadley, Shifnal and Newport, which is an historic market town on the border with Staffordshire, popular with pensioners and the middle classes. The sparsely populated countryside is the site of some farming and the Harper Adams University College is a renowned provider of agricultural training. The Wrekin is a hill visible from miles around, giving rise to the regional phrase \u201call around the Wrekin\u201d, meaning to take the long way round. This seat was Labour from 1997 to 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mark Pritchard"
"596","644","Wyre Forest","Wyre_Forest","Bisected by the River Severn, this northern seat has a triangle of three main towns: Kidderminster, by far the biggest, Stourport on Severn and Bewdley. A mixed seat, there are pockets of severe deprivation in Kidderminster but also some extremely affluent areas. The seat is generally averagely well off. Labour overturned decades of Tory rule in 1997, only to be defeated in 2001 by Richard Taylor fighting as an independent to maintain services at Kidderminster Hospital.","The current KHHC MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Richard Taylor"
"597","29","Barnsley Central","Barnsley_Central","Barnsley occupies a strategic position north of Sheffield, on main commuter routes between the city and Leeds. Under boundary changes the seat has gained the relatively affluent village of Darton in the north-west, alongside the M1. At the start of the Eighties, a fifth of Barnsley\u2019s workforce was in coalmining; pit closures hit the town hard. It has yet to recover fully but a \u00a3350 million redevelopment of the centre includes a transport interchange, digital media centre and indoor market. The seat has long been a Labour stronghold.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Eric Illsley"
"598","30","Barnsley East","Barnsley_East","This constituency bears only a minimal resemblance to the old Barnsley East and Mexborough seat, having lost Mexborough and Dearne Valley and gained the communities of Worsbrough and Hoyland, south of Barnsley town. This scattering of urban areas includes some severe deprivation, with poor health and high unemployment typifying the former mining communities. Grimethorpe was the setting for the film Brassed Off. This has long been a staunch Labour area.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jeff Ennis"
"599","37","Batley & Spen","Batley_and_Spen","Just south of Bradford, this seat has gained more than 10,000 constituents, mostly by the addition of the former mill town of Heckmondwike, which, like Batley, is predominantly working-class and Labour-leaning. Spen Valley at the west is more middle-class commuter territory. Over a quarter of residents work in manufacturing, many in traditional textile industries. About 15 per cent of the population is non-white, mainly of Indian Muslim heritage. The seat was Tory at its inception in 1983 but changed to Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mike Wood"
"600","53","Beverley & Holderness","Beverley_and_Holderness","The market town of Beverley, that in 2008 topped a survey of towns where an affluent lifestyle could be achieved at the most affordable price, lies ten miles northwest of Hull. The constituency curves southeast around the city and along the Holderness coast, including the seaside towns of Hornsea and Withensea. It is prime commuter territory and relatively wealthy. The BP refinery at Saltend is in less prosperous territory. Tories traditionally dominated the area but won only narrow majorities after the seat\u2019s creation in 1997.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Graham Stuart"
"601","85","Bradford East","Bradford_East","Essentially the old Bradford North, this new name more accurately reflects its position, reaching from the River Aire at the north down to the south-east of the city centre. There is a large manufacturing sector but much unemployment, including high numbers of those who have never worked. About a quarter of residents are Asian, by far the biggest number Pakistani. The constituency last changed hands in 1987, when Labour won.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Terry Rooney"
"602","86","Bradford South","Bradford_South","From Queensbury, high in the Pennines at the west, this wide seat stretches over to Tong village in the east. It mostly skirts the south of Bradford centre and although jutting up north to include Lidget Green, scene of race riots in April 2001, it has by far the lowest ethnic minority population of the three Bradford seats. Areas of deprivation follow long-term decline of wool industries in a predominantly working-class seat with a long Labour tradition.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Gerry Sutcliffe"
"603","87","Bradford West","Bradford_West","The eastern side of the constituency includes Bradford city centre, with its university, college and commercial hub. From there the seat stretches west to the suburbs of Clayton, home to many professionals. A mixed seat, there are still large areas of deprivation in what was once the wool capital of the world. It has one of Britain\u2019s largest ethnic minority populations and inner-city Manningham was the scene of race riots in July 2001. Though held by Labour from 1983, majorities were sometimes slim.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Marsha Singh"
"604","96","Brigg & Goole","Brigg_and_Goole","Follow the Humber 28 miles inland from Hull and you will find Goole, a port town with a more prosperous past than now in construction and manufacturing. South of the river, in north Lincolnshire, villages and rural towns lie either side of Scunthorpe, that is not in the constituency. West lies Epworth, home of Methodism&apos;s founder, John Wesley, and to the east is Brigg. There is a strong agricultural sector and good transport links, due to the M180. Labour won the seat on its creation in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ian Cawsey"
"605","116","Calder Valley","Calder_Valley","The western half of this Yorkshire seat is predominantly rural, with occasional settlements such as Todmorden and Hebden Bridge, a town with a bohemian reputation that is home to artists and writers. As the constituency curves round the south-east outskirts of Halifax it is more densely populated, with Elland and Brighouse, a centre of manufacturing, near the M62. An economically active seat, with above average numbers of middle-class professionals and the working classes, it was held by the Tories from its 1983 creation until Labour\u2019s 1997 landslide.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Christine McCafferty"
"606","153","Cleethorpes","Cleethorpes","From Barton-on-Humber, southern entrance to the Humber Bridge, the seat stretches south to the downmarket holiday resort of Cleethorpes. It straddles the North and North East Lincolnshire boundaries but excludes Grimsby. Cleethorpes and Immingham \u2013 that with Grimsby is Britain\u2019s largest port by tonnage \u2013 have areas of severe deprivation. At North Killingholme, near Immingham, construction workers at the Lindsey oil refinery took strike action in 2009. Although the seat returned a Labour MP on its creation in 1997, the Tories had success in predecessor seats.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Shona McIsaac"
"607","158","Colne Valley","Colne_Valley","Large sweeps of rural land between Greater Manchester and Huddersfield make up the main area but the population is concentrated in the north. This includes west Huddersfield, with its hospital, suburbs such as Golcar and the village of Honley. There are patches of deprivation here but the seat is economically active, with many middle-class professionals. The BBC comedy series Last of the Summer Wine is filmed at Holmfirth. The M62 loosely binds the constituency to the north. The seat has changed hands between the three main parties.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Kali Mountford"
"608","193","Dewsbury","Dewsbury","The hilly town of Dewsbury, roughly equidistant between Huddersfield to its west and Bradford and Leeds to the north, is at the northern extremity of the seat. Southern boundaries have been extended through the moorland to Denby Dale, increasing the electorate by 13,000. In 2005 Dewsbury had the highest BNP vote of any constituency, reflecting divisions between poor, white-dominated estates, such as Dewsbury Moor, home to the \u201ckidnapped\u201d schoolgirl Shannon Matthews, and enclaves such as Savile Town, where more than 90 per cent of people are Muslim. Labour has held here since 1987.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Shahid Malik"
"609","194","Don Valley","Don_Valley","Curving south and east of Doncaster, the south Yorkshire seat is predominantly rural. At the west is Edlington, the former pit village where in 2009 two young brothers tortured two children. Rossington and Auckley are at the centre and Thorne, newly added in the north-east, is a market town amid a flat, canalled landscape known as Little Holland. Severe deprivation has followed pit closures, though there has been regeneration. EU funding helped to build Robin Hood Airport, near Doncaster. The seat has a long Labour history.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Caroline Flint"
"610","195","Doncaster Central","Doncaster_Central","Set on the Don in the south Yorkshire coalfields, the town suffered from Eighties pit closures. Regeneration projects have injected \u00a31billion since the millennium but much of the borough remains severely deprived. Since the mid-Nineties, a series of scandals have made Doncaster a byword for local government corruption and incompetence, most recently with lamentable failings in its children&apos;s services. There is a small Pakistani community and the BNP and UKIP have had a presence in recent elections. Once held by the Tories, it has been Labour since 1964.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Rosie Winterton"
"611","196","Doncaster North","Doncaster_North","Substantially larger than the old seat of the same name, the south Yorkshire constituency reaches to Mexborough in the west and covers largely rural areas north of Doncaster. Bentley lies on the northern banks of the Don and Adwick is further north. The strongly working-class seat has yet to recover fully from the decline of the coal industry but large numbers work in construction and manufacturing. The seat routinely polls over 50 per cent for Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Ed Miliband"
"612","235","Elmet & Rothwell","Elmet_and_Rothwell","Elmet is the old name for the sweep of West Yorkshire countryside that comprises the bulk of this seat, to the eastern side of Leeds, including the affluent commuter town of Wetherby. Further south are former mining communities which, though relatively prosperous, remain Labour-leaning. The boundaries have been extended to include the populous and less well-off Rothwell, at the southwestern extremity. The constituency was Conservative from its inception in 1983 until 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Colin Burgon"
"613","276","Great Grimsby","Great_Grimsby","The port of Grimsby lies on the south bank of the Humber, near the estuary\u2019s mouth. Although the fishing industry that traditionally dominated the constituency has declined, Grimsby\u2019s biggest private employer remains Young\u2019s Seafood. Chemical and petrol companies have a strong presence. Overwhelmingly white and strongly working-class, the seat suffers from high unemployment. It has been Labour since the Second World War. ","The current Labour MP for this seat is Austin Mitchell"
"614","283","Halifax","Halifax","Halifax gave its name to the bank whose current incarnation, the troubled HBOS, is the biggest private employer in this West Yorkshire seat. Once a wool town, it retains a large working-class and manufacturing presence, returning a Labour MP for most of its recent history. The seat briefly turned blue during the Thatcher years. About 10 per cent of the population is of Asian origin and the BNP has had some success. Labour has held the seat since 1987 but margins of victory have often been narrow.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Linda Riordan"
"615","284","Haltemprice & Howden","Haltemprice_and_Howden","The constituency, dominated by farmland, stretches along the M62, from commuter villages, including Cottingham, west of Hull that contain 70 per cent of the electorate to Howden, a few miles north of Goole. The Press Association is a main employer in Howden and BAE Systems is the big name at Brough. The economy is dominated by professionals in service sectors. Although traditionally Tory, the Lib Dems have been a strong second in some recent elections. In 2008 David Davis, MP since 1987, forced an unopposed by-election to highlight civil liberties.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Davis"
"616","293","Harrogate & Knaresborough","Harrogate_and_Knaresborough","Sixteen miles north of Leeds, these neighbouring towns form the core of a small seat extended to include a rural area to the north-east, formerly in the Skipton and Ripon seat. Parts of Harrogate are within the least deprived 1 per cent of Britain and it has six of Yorkshire&apos;s ten most expensive streets. Its spa and the English tea-time treats produced by Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate make it important for tourism. Before turning Lib Dem in 1997 it was staunchly Conservative.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Phil Willis"
"617","303","Hemsworth","Hemsworth","Lying south-east of Wakefield, much of this West Yorkshire constituency is Green Belt land, untouched by motorways. The population is concentrated in Hemsworth and South Kirkby, towns at the seat\u2019s southern boundary that have severe deprivation. An economy dependent on coalmining was devastated by pit closures. Associated problems of poor health persist and large numbers of people work in routine occupations. This was traditionally seen as one of Labour\u2019s safest seats.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Jon Trickett"
"618","322","Huddersfield","Huddersfield","About 10 miles south of Bradford, the town of Huddersfield was built around the wool industry and retains its working-class roots. Areas of deprivation blight the centre and there is a high proportion of social housing and much unemployment. But there is a strong education sector and because of the town\u2019s university one in ten electors are students. About one in five residents is of ethnic minority origin, the largest community being Pakistani. Labour has held the seat since its creation in 1950.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Barry Sheerman"

The seat covers people living east of the River Hull, that flows through the city from north to south. It includes industrial docks on the Humber waterfront and is strongly working-class and overwhelmingly white. The BP refinery is a big employer. Regeneration has focused on housing. A third of the population lives in council or social housing. John Prescott, the former Deputy Prime Minister, announced his retirement after colourfully representing the constituency for 40 years.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Prescott"
"620","324","Hull North","Kingston-upon-Hull_North","Set back from the Humber estuary, this northern half of Hull is a seat of contrasts. There is a large student population \u2013 about 13 per cent of residents \u2013 attending the University of Hull, but also traditional \u2013 and deprived \u2013 working-class residential areas. One of them is Bransholme, an isolated urban wasteland five miles north-east of the city centre. One of Europe&apos;s largest council estates, it is viewed by many as a monument to the errors of 1960s town planners. The seat has returned Labour MPs since 1966.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Diana Johnson"
"621","325","Hull West & Hessle","Kingston-upon-Hull_West_and_Hessle","The retail heart of Hull city is included in this seat, along with a stretch of estuary including Humber Quays which, after extensive regeneration, has become a base for Royal Bank of Scotland, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Barclays and other financial service companies. Most of the waterfront remains warehousing and the south of the constituency is generally deprived. At the west of the seat, Hessle is a more affluent commuter suburb. The seat has been Labour since its creation in 1955.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Alan Johnson"
"622","338","Keighley","Keighley","This West Yorkshire seat has dramatic contrasts in wealth. It is centred on the poor, working-class town of Keighley, north-west of Bradford, where manufacturing is strong. Surrounding rural communities, including Haworth, once home to the Bront\u00eb sisters, are far more affluent. Commuter-belt Ilkley, in the north, has one of Britain&apos;s highest proportions of millionaires. About one in ten residents are ethnic minority and Nick Griffin garnered 9 per cent of votes for the BNP in 2005. Labour overturned 14 years of Tory representation in 1997.","The current Labour MP for this seat is Ann Cryer"
"623","351","Leeds Central","Leeds_Central","Leeds business and retail centre is at the heart of the constituency. Despite this relatively prosperous hub, the seat is severely deprived residentially, typified by row upon row of terraced houses, home to Labour-leaning working classes. There is high unemployment. The two universities produce a significant student population. Boundaries to the south have been expanded substantially to include the suburbs of Middleton and Belle Isle.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Hilary Benn"
"624","352","Leeds East","Leeds_East","This predominantly residential seat has large areas of severe deprivation, particularly in areas such as Gipton and Harehills, where tower blocks look out over run-down council housing and boarded-up properties. Over a third live in social housing in this traditionally staunchly Labour seat. There are patches of greater affluence in the south-east, with the disparity said to fuel crime rates. Employment is low but health sector employment is well above average, with Seacroft Hospital in the constituency .

"625","353","Leeds North East","Leeds_North_East","A seat with extremes of wealth, Leeds North East has lost a chunk of the sparsely populated, affluent and semi-rural area from its north and gained further densely populated inner-city areas at the south. These are a mixture of prosperous professional parts and pockets of severe deprivation where many live in social housing. Chapeltown\u2019s back-to-back Victorian terraces house a large ethnic minority population that forms a tenth of the electorate. Under previous boundaries the seat was long held by the Tories before Labour took over in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Fabian Hamilton"
"626","354","Leeds North West","Leeds_North_West","This triangular seat stretches north and west from Headingley, home to cricket and Rugby League stadiums and a large Leeds Metropolitan University campus. It takes in the suburban villages of Adel, Yeadon and Bramhope, the market town of Otley and Leeds Bradford International Airport. This affluent constituency is home to many professionals and notable for a student population comprising over a quarter of the electorate. Once regarded as a safe Conservative seat, it switched to Labour in 1997 before being taken by the Lib Dems in 2005.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Greg Mulholland"
"627","355","Leeds West","Leeds_West","The deprived working-class north of this seat, around Bramley, is dominated by council housing, It contrasts with the averagely well-off south; the middle classes are well represented in the greener streets of Wortley and Farnley. Leeds Metropolitan University lies on the other side of the north-eastern boundary but makes Kirkstall, home to a ruined abbey, increasingly popular with students, who comprise about one in ten electors.

"628","405","Morley & Outwood","Morley_and_Outwood","Morley is an old market town to the south-west of Leeds that has fought resolutely to maintain independence from the city on its doorstep. Boundary changes have taken away nearby Rothwell but added the more prosperous Outwood, forming a constituency criss-crossed by the M1, M62 and M621. Strong road links are helping to turn these former mining and textile communities into commuter territory. There remains a strong working-class presence and about a sixth of the population lives in social or council housing. Predecessor seats were historically Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Colin Challon"
"629","426","Normanton, Pontefract & Castleford","Normanton__Pontefract_and_Castleford","Normanton, previously at the eastern extremity of its own seat, is now added to the western extremity of the Pontefract and Castleford constituency. These three towns and Knottingley are clustered around the motorways that criss-cross the seat.

Regeneration is helping to improve the towns\u2019 economic prospects. The constituency has long been staunchly Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Yvette Cooper"
"630","448","Penistone & Stocksbridge","Penistone_and_Stocksbridge","Straddling the border between the borough of Barnsley in the north and Sheffield district in the south, this new seat is named after two small towns amid large areas of the rural Pennines to the west. While livestock farms cover much of the land, many residents are affluent commuters. The seat is bounded by the M1 at the east and Ecclesfield lies at the south-eastern corner, on the outskirts of Sheffield. The predecessor seats in this area were both Labour.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"631","461","Pudsey","Pudsey","Pudsey town lies in the south of this seat, that is popular with commuters and is sandwiched between Leeds and Bradford. In the north are Calverley, Horsforth, a Domesday Book settlement that became Britain&apos;s largest village in the late 19th century, and the town of Guiseley, home to the original Harry Ramsden&apos;s fish and chip shop. Affluence varies from prosperous, semi-rural areas to aspirational urban communities. The constituency was Conservative from 1922 until a dramatic win by Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Paul Truswell"
"632","472","Richmond (Yorks)","Richmond_Yorks","Bordering Cumbria to the west, this large rural seat stretches east from the Pennines to the Vale of York and has been enlarged to the south. The two main towns are Richmond and Northallerton but much of the population live in villages, many within the Yorkshire Dales National Park, lynchpin of the tourism sector. There is a large agricultural sector, especially sheep farming. Catterick Garrison, Britain\u2019s largest army base, has 7,500 regular soldiers and thousands of recruits and civilian staff. This is one of the safest Tory seats.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is William Hague"
"633","481","Rother Valley","Rother_Valley","At the very south of Yorkshire, this seat has large rural expanses dotted with suburban areas such as Broom, Whiston and Swallownest. Well-connected by the M1, they are popular with commuters to Rotherham (to the north) and Sheffield (to the west). Further east there are less affluent former mining settlements such as Maltby \u2013 where deprivation is evident in both the old housing and new council estates \u2013 and the former pit village of Thurcroft. This constituency has long been staunchly Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Kevin Barron"
"634","482","Rotherham","Rotherham","Across the M1 to the north-east of Sheffield, Rotherham is a former steel and coal town that has suffered from the industries\u2019 long-term decline. South Yorkshire received EU funding for regeneration in the past decade but further recent job cuts have hit hard. From the terraces of Masbrough, in the centre, to council estates further out, much of the town remains severely deprived. Rotherham\u2019s ethnic minority community is concentrated in the north, with some tensions reflected in BNP success locally. The seat has been Labour since 1933.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Dennis MacShane"
"635","497","Scarborough & Whitby","Scarborough_and_Whitby","The two towns are the main population centres of a seat covering a vast stretch of North Yorkshire coastline, extending inland to the North York Moors National Park. Scarborough, home of the playwright Sir Alan Ayckbourn and a cricket festival, is the larger, more traditional seaside resort. Whitby, with its ruined Gothic abbey and narrow cobbled streets surrounding a working port, has a more upmarket reputation. Fishing and tourism have declined from their heydays, giving rise to pockets of deprivation. Voters surprisingly elected a Labour MP for 1997-2005.","The current Tory MP for this seat is Robert Goodwill"
"636","498","Scunthorpe","Scunthorpe","Scunthorpe lies at the north with a rural area, separated by the M180, to the south. Known as the \u201cindustrial garden town\u201d, it was built round the steel industry and has suffered with its decline. Corus remains the chief employer but has made redundancies. Once grouped with other areas, Scunthorpe has been represented by a variety of parties, but since gaining its own seat in 1997 has been seen as safely Labour. Its outgoing MP, Elliot Morley, is standing down after being accused of false accounting of his expenses.","The current MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Elliot Morley, who was suspended from the Labour party in February"
"637","501","Selby & Ainsty","Selby_and_Ainsty","Selby, a market town on the Ouse, remains at the heart but the seat has lost an area on the outskirts of York. It curves north-west, skirting Leeds and extending almost to Harrogate. The seat is mostly rural with commuter villages dotted through the flat, fertile Vale of York. Coal mines have closed but the Drax coal power station remains and there is a strong manufacturing sector. A small monument by a field near Tockwith marks the Civil War Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. Traditionally a Tory area, the seat switched to Labour in 1997.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Grogan"
"638","503","Sheffield Brightside & Hillsborough","Sheffield__Brightside_and_Hillsborough","From the edge of the city centre, the constituency rises up the hillsides to the north and latches Hillsborough, home to Sheffield Wednesday FC, to the old Brightside seat. It encompasses areas such as Burngreave, Parsons Cross, Shirebank and Wincobank, as well as the Northern General Hospital, a significant employer. An overwhelmingly working-class seat, with almost half the population living in council or social housing, this is the poorest of the Sheffield seats and has long been a Labour stronghold.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Blunkett"
"639","504","Sheffield Central","Sheffield_Central","The city centre contains the cathedral, city hall and shopping centre. Development has transformed it, with highlights including the enclosed Winter Garden, Millennium Galleries and new-look railway station. The seat reaches east to the deprived Manor council estate and to the west branches out in a triangle, with Walkley and Nether Edge at the extremities. The University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University mean that a quarter of residents are students. Another quarter are from an ethnic minority background. Labour has long represented the seat.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Richard Caborn"
"640","505","Sheffield Hallam","Sheffield_Hallam","In a city divided between haves and have-nots, with a 14-year difference in life expectancy, this second wealthiest seat beyond London and the South East is resolutely for the haves. It encompasses western fringes of Sheffield and the countryside beyond. Over a third of residents are professionals; the number of \u201chigher professionals\u201d is double the national average and triple that for Yorkshire and the Humber. A fifth of residents are students. Liberal Democrats took the constituency with a dramatic swing in 1997.","The current Lib Dem MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Nick Clegg"
"641","506","Sheffield Heeley","Sheffield__Heeley","To the south of Sheffield city centre, the seat stretches down to the border with Derbyshire. It is a mixed: a third of people live in council or social housing and there are patches of deprivation at the north and south but some lower-middle class groups are well represented, as are skilled manual workers. There are fewer students or top professionals than in the centre and the population is predominantly white. The area has had a diverse political history under varied boundaries but since 1983 has been represented by Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Meg Munn"
"642","507","Sheffield South East","Sheffield_South_East","This seat could more accurately be called Sheffield East, based as it is on the old Sheffield Attercliffe seat. It has been extended slightly toward the city centre but remains less cosmopolitan than its neighbour. It is home to a greater proportion of white residents and more working and lower-middle classes. Many steel works were once here and there are still large industrial parks at the north, joined by the huge Meadowhall shopping centre and Sheffield City Airport. The constituency has traditionally returned huge Labour majorities.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Clive Betts"
"643","509","Shipley","Shipley","This West Yorkshire seat\u2019s three main settlements of Shipley, Baildon and Bingley are clustered at the centre, a few miles north of Bradford. With semi-rural land on either side, this is primarily a residential seat, home to large numbers of middle-class professionals, and is predominantly white. Saltaire village, a Unesco World Heritage Site, lies between Shipley and Bingley. Only small patches of deprivation exist, concentrated in central Shipley, but Labour nevertheless held here from 1997 to 2005.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Philip Davies"
"644","513","Skipton & Ripon","Skipton_and_Ripon","The name reflects the two biggest market towns in a rural North Yorkshire seat that encompasses sweeps of moorland and hills \u2013 much of the west is in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Slightly redrawn, it loses some villages on the outskirts of Harrogate but reaches further east, beyond Ripon. Traditional trades of quarrying and agriculture remain, though in decline, and tourism and financial services are big employers. The seat is comfortably off but has few truly affluent areas. It has been Tory since its inception in 1983.","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is David Curry"
"645","569","Thirsk & Malton","Thirsk_and_Malton","This new seat encompasses most of the old Ryedale seat, excluding fringes of York but including the eastern half of the defunct Vale of York seat. It stretches from Filey on the coast to Thirsk at the west; Malton lies roughly in the centre. There is a significant agricultural sector and Thirsk was the market town at the heart of the James Herriot veterinary tales. Food and drink industries, engineering and tourism are big employers. This area has long been staunchly Conservative.\n\nNOTE: Because of the death of the UKIP candidate, the election in Thirsk & Malton has been delayed until May 27. Ladbrokes is not currently offering any odds in this seat\n","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Greenway"
"646","591","Wakefield","Wakefield","At the heart of West Yorkshire\u2019s former mining area, Wakefield is yet to recover fully from the industry\u2019s decline and has patches of severe deprivation. The city\u2019s economy is increasingly diverse and though the seat has always returned Labour MPs since the Second World War, margins of victory under old boundaries were sometimes narrow. Substantial boundary changes mean the seat loses a large, sparsely-populated rural area to its south-west and gains the market town of Ossett in the north. Under old boundaries, the constituency was reliably Labour.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Mary Creagh"
"647","611","Wentworth & Dearne","Wentworth_and_Dearne","To the north-east of Rotherham, the seat has lost some areas from the south, now extending only as far as Bramley. It gains the lowlands area of Dearne Valley at the north, mainly deprived former mining communities. Wath-upon-Dearne and Swinton are the chief towns and the industrial area near the former Manvers Main Colliery provides employment for many. The west is more rural while, further south, the Corus steelworks at Aldwarke have been hard hit by job cuts. Labour majorities have historically been large.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is John Healey"
"648","648","York Central","York_Central","The renamed City of York seat has lost one populous ward from the south west and a couple of part wards but the heart remains the same. Its Roman, Viking and medieval heritage make it a popular tourist destination. Dominating the city is York Minster, northern Europe&apos;s largest Gothic cathedral. The mixed economy includes manufacturing, notably confectionery with Nestl\u00e9, and financial services, with Aviva. The inner city has a young professional feel. The constituency changed hands several times, most recently to Labour in 1992.","The current Labour MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Hugh Bayley"
"649","649","York Outer","York_Outer","Forming a ring around York, this seat is created out of territory from four others. The inner boundary includes the University of York at Heslington, which contributes a significant student vote and shapes the economy through science and technology sectors. The constituency includes the suburbs of Woodthorpe, Dringhouses, Huntingdon and Rawcliffe. Beyond the ring road are commuter villages including Wheldrake, Haxby and the Poppletons. This affluent seat has higher numbers of retired people than the city centre. Predecessor seats had a mixed political history.","This is a new seat which does not correspond closely to that of any sitting MP"
"650","650","Yorkshire East","East_Yorkshire","Stretching from the coast at Bridlington almost to York, with Driffield at the centre, this is a large and predominantly rural seat. A notable sector of the population works in agriculture and there are above-average numbers of self-employed. Too distant for convenient commuting to Hull, it is less affluent than other rural seats in the East Riding. The resort of Bridlington is very much the poor relation of Scarborough and Whitby. The constituency has been Tory since its creation in 1997 but not always with great majorities. ","The current Tory MP for the corresponding seat under old boundaries is Greg Knight"
